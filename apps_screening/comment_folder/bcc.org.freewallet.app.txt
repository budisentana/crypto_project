After two weeks since transaction where I transferred bcc to butcoin wallet (perfectly allowed and advertised at the time by freewallet), my balance has been 0 and money was not recieved. I was told by freewallet support that I will get a refund and was not told when. This was a week ago. Nothing. No questions have been answered past that. My texts are just ignored.  The answer to this review was not helpful and generic plus it was in conflict with the answer I recieved from cuatomer service. Where is the promised refund??? 2 weeks is an incredibly long time for something so volatile!  Update #3: your response to my review is identical to previous one, not helpful and does not address the issues listed in updated review above. Freewallet does not respond to my texts through the app for weeks (are they not public enough to embarass you?). I was promised a refund for transaction equivalent to about $220 and I was refunded what looks like a fee ($4).

A wallet should never need to refund you, it just isn't so much a part of bitcoin or any other crypto currency at this time for that matter.. I would be very careful giving someone access to your private keys. Remember, these can contain your normal bitcoin private keys as well as your BCH(BCC) since they both branched out of the same stock or at least one did out of the other.. Remember, Always keep your private keys private unless it's a company you have better chances won't take your money like coinbase. (You can't view your private keys on coinbase, not my favorite feature there..). It's easy to have an app on Google play store and to keep it's score artificially high in one way or another.
