No way am I trusting my money with this until you get a better development/management team.  Edit: Dear team, thank you for your prompt response. Android best practices for runtime permissions suggest that when asking for certain permissions that the user may find suspicious (this one is a great example), the app should first explain to the user why it wants said permission. In your app's case, for example, a simple dialog box before prompting for all my contact details (which you don't even need) would be a great addition. I would still have said no, but may not feel like this is an insecure product.  Please understand, the level of trust required for some people to store their wealth in a mobile wallet is high.
