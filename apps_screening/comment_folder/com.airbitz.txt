For years I had stuck with Blockchain as my mobile wallet because it worked on Android and IOS and could be restored even when a backup of the wallet was unavailable.  On top of that, all my data was encrypted client-side so, unlike Circle and Coinbase to name a couple, Blockchain never had my private keys.  I diligently used 2-factor authentication along with complex passwords to keep it secure and never had any issues.  My friends and family, however, had all kinds of issues with Blockchain.  It was just too complicated for them and a couple ended up forgetting their passwords resulting in lost bitcoins.  Airbitz is the first wallet I came across that has all the online redundancy and security of Blockchain but with a much more polished and user-friendly interface.  It's now the only mobile wallet I use and recommend to others.  Bear in mind I do NOT use this, or any other mobile wallet, for storing the bulk of my bitcoins.
