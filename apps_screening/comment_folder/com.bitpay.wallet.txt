I promise to change my review if the developer sees this, and makes an effort to fix, or at least address my issues. And I really wanted this to be a good app since I like the idea of a bitcoin debit card. 1st of all, what made me decide to get it, was countless Facebook adds claiming that if you use a discount code, they will wave the fee for ordering a card (around $10). I spent about 20-30 attempts to use the code, but was told \"incorrect code\" and had to pay the $10 fee that was advertised as free. Put a small balance of bitcoin on my card, and it was declined at every store I tried it at. They advertise that you could store bitcoin on the card, but be able to spend the bitcoin at the store like a normal debit card. And lastly, they don't mention the extremely high \"miner fees\" for every transaction, so me sending $10 worth cost me total of $28","replyDate":"2021-02-19T14:17:36.514Z","replyText":"Hi Alex,\nThank you for reaching out, and I'm so sorry to hear you've had so many issues ordering and using our card.

I was just withdrawing funds from Robinhood \nfrom stock gains of $11.22..but before said and done, cost me $10..it took \nme 5 months for my little stocks to build me $11 profit, and these crooks \ntook in less than 24 hours..

My displeasure is not with BitPay, however there are many banking \noptions they have available to service their cards, and they chose the one \nthat will chathe you a $5 to use ACH transfer (from your account out) they \ndon't charge to get incoming).. Also, I turned to other currency options \nand account types to separate my funds from traditional checking accounts \nto avoid fees, and possibilities of temptation and mistakes that cost more \nfees to an already over regulated system we ultimately can't do without..

However, bitpay \ncard is the only card I saw where I could send my BitcoinCash from a wallet \nI had nothing to withdraw from for approx $0.04 fee and spend like a bank \ncard at the grocery store.. I apologize for and meant no bad name for \nBitPay other than their banks fee.. Its like cashing a check drawn on Bank \nof America without an account getting charged $6 and it took the teller 30 \nseconds and verified a signature and amount available to do so.. There is \nno risk, and not the best way to get new customers in to open \naccounts..sorry about the rant.. I am just over it all with the BS we have \nevolved into..
