In June 2020 this app works very well, no bugs or issues as I can see. It's very simple to use, small fees, good support by email and on Twitter. I've just exchanged 2,000 USD worth coins at once, because I'm 100% sure it's safe. Important! Connect app with Shapeshift, so you will have no issues with transactions like many people wrote here. Go to Menu, Tools, Third party authorization.","replyDate":"2020-06-29T12:42:39.830Z","replyText":"Thanks for your review!

I highly recommend it. ____________________ Previous review: I'm giving this a 1 star review due to the fact that I cant pair my existing wallet from the original Jaxx wallet. I love Jaxx and had high hopes for this, but it simply just doesn't work. I've contacted support and they still haven't figured out the issue and eventually came back and said that multiple people have reported this so they are working on a fix. Once they fix the issue and I can pair my wallet, I'll redo my review.","replyDate":"2018-10-05T16:39:24.220Z","replyText":"Hi Matt and thank you for the feedback and support!
