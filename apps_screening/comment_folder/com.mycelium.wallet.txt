The one black spot on the service is that I underbid on the mining fee because i was 2$ short on the price my vendor needed. I got 0 conformations in 24 hours and not knowing what to do i contacted my vendor who said it could take up to a week to get my money back in my wallet - right now its perpetually \"sending\", yet not moving. There is an option to boost the mining fee, my initial fee was 90$ (minus the almost 15% fee the app took), and i sent out my order and was horrified when the next day it had zero confirmations. My vendor said I MAY or may not recieve my 90$ worth of btc in a week, is that true (for those in the know). I put 40$ in the next day to bump up the fee and it said insufficient funds. SO if 40$ cant boost a 90$ transaction, id hate to find out what would... Can anyone from mycelium explain how ill get my money back, its stick \"sending\" in limbo for 48 hours. Is there ANY way i can make it worth it to the miners besides boosting the fee (it was a complete failure. Now i have 90$ that i dont know if ill ever see again. I will withdraw my rating based on the hope that someone working for the app company can get my money back to me without waiting a week. I had to go out the next day and buy 40$ more btc to get a much smaller order which wont hold me... Any advice and ill make another review of 5 stars and also keep praising you guys by word of mouth.

It used to be hands down the best bitcoin wallet for Android. I can't even imagine how many hundreds of people I've got to install it throughout the years.  First it was their ICO. They popped up an ad inside the wallet asking users to invest in a token that \"represents\" shares in the company (without any real equity given, of course). They bilked their own users out of several million dollars and as far as I know have never made any efforts to deliver on promises made or return funds taken.  Then it was the advertising inside the app. For a product that is supposed to secure funds, the idea of inserting third party anything inside \"my bank vault,\" the ads debacle was completely unacceptable. They tried defending it at first, but only through enough customer backlash did they end up reverting it.  Then it was the departures of anyone sane left working for them. For years their community manager, Rassah, was a wise and trustworthy face that could always be counted on to answer questions directed at the company. His recent departure should be throwing up huge warning signs.  Finally, their highly political decision to not support Bitcoin Cash when every other wallet of note was able to activate BCC support in a timely manner. If I'm trusting an app with my money, I don't want the developers behind it playing political games. If my bitcoin stored in the app suddenly also grants me bitcoin cash, I'd like my preferred wallet to make it easy for me to access.  I could write so much more, but will stop here as these are my biggest gripes. It's been a good three or four years using this app, and I'm saddened to witness the slow decline of this company and their product.

I hate phone keyboards in general, but this one doesn't even rotate to scale if you turn your device into Landscape mode, thus reducing accuracy on small screens. It also really obfuscates the backspace button because it's under your thumb the whole time. I messed up a whole bunch of work typing in letters by hitting Back rather than Backspace because it was so unintuitive as to how to backspace. 3) Don't just gray out the Send button when some of the details for a transaction are missing! *TELL* us what's wrong! It took me a while to realize where to input the destination address given the generic vertical LinearLayout styling from 2012 that's used on the transaction page, with no modern Android UI styling panache. Oh, and the laughable Toast messages when you change the transaction rate tells me this feature is still a little bit half-baked. This being said, it did save me from writing my own Bitcoin API client. ;) I will still recommend Mycelium to anyone looking to transact BTC, but would have to spend some time explaining the UI.","replyDate":"2017-06-17T02:52:53.980Z","replyText":"Ok, noted.
