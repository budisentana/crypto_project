However, a few grammatical errors can be found (for example, using the wrong form of \"there\") which makes me trust the app a little less. Another problem is that it likes to make any mental health problems about depression and suicide. I have autism, and I wanted to see if it would pick that up—it didn't. I also have gender dysphoria, and it had no options to specify that most of my depression-related symptoms improved slightly as I started my transition.","This has made life easier and consultancy charges has been reduced, also if one can give very honest feedback, one will get a result that is almost identical to what a local doctor would have recommended, I can attest to that based on my experience, cheers. Am I not enjoying Ada. I hope the app developers are benefiting from my data. That is the only way I can pay them back for a job well done programming this app. Kudos guys.","The questions were detailed but not too invasive or uncomfortable. The overall assessment actually made sense since what it gave me apparently runs in my family. This app was very helpful in educating me on the issues as well.","I described a fluey cold, and the app, questions, information and advice was good. NB. I think best to describe as a 'fluey cold' eg by an adenovirus and a mild illness. Ie rather than describe as 'flu'... because 'flu' is word also used as short for influenza, which is a more severe condition caused by the seasonal influenza virus.","Its a nice apps that can be used both in the hospital when in huge cue waiting for a doctor.

Also, I'm running latest firmware that allows me to record speed through transmission values but that also is NOT shown in the app. The only thing that seams to be working are lap times, but that's the least important thing for data analysis. I wanted to shop for the EGT but now I'm not because I don't know if I'm gonna get the correct data in ADA.

Also bears and boars are way to aggressive and should be on the other island.

It was nice to see it again but I feel like It's gotten worse. For starters, they removed the park which was quite disappointing seeing as that was my favourite area. Another thing is that they removed the feature to walk around the mall and go outside which yet again was quite pointless to remove. One of the reasons I played this game was because it was unique but now its a copy of Toca Boca.","I love the game it's a nice game the reason is I rate it 3 stars is you have removed the 24 hrs free and u haven't added clothes option and unlocked the mansion at last I would like to request that please unlock all the the things that I have mentioned up till then bye","I used to play this game when I was younger, so the prices r cheap and I think the mall and town is unlocked but Where's the park? 🥺 Anyways I still like this game lol","Hi ! Super cool game I love it it has a house and more things than toca life I really recommend. But I think there should be more places than only 1","I LOVE THIS GAME!!! ITS JUST THE BEST!!!

Right now it just keeps delaying when I'm playing it (without Bluetooth) and kicks me out of the app. I don't know if it's my phone or something but that doesn't happen with any other app than this one. Really, I do love how lots of the drums sound but the delay is just ridiculous.","It's a very nice app, easy to use, nice graphics, and much more. But the reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because in order to learn a new lesson you have to watch an ad, which is pretty annoying... You can atleast keep a watch an ad to learn lesson after every 3 lessons, then it wouldn't be so annoying... So please do try to fix this, If you do then I'll definitely try to give 5 stars... Thanks","The most responsive and cleanest drum app on Play Place.. so many kits for endless amounts of fun and creativity.. Update*: Was my favorite app until Android 11, now it won't open once you download a new kit outside of the original. Update a fix and I'll give 5 stars. Update**: still the most responsive and cleanest drum app here, but with the weekly releases it seems to just be different kits of recycled sounds. The band targeted ones also sound nothing like the artist usually. Still the best","I like this app but there are waaaaay to many ads. I am fine with ads to support the developers but it's just too many. You play for a min and then get 30 sec ads. It's hard to keep motivated with so many interruptions. This is the second time I've downloaded this and the second time I'm uninstalling. I hope this issue is resolved in the future.","My phone is Oppo A5 2020, is there some way I can fix the issue of lag or delay when I am playing this app on this phone. I've tried several things that I know to fix the lag/delay but still they do not work. Anyway I've been using this app since 2018 on my old Samsung phone and it plays very well but when I switched to Oppo it started to show delays in sound whenever I try to play it.

My sisters play this game like everyday. The only thing that bothers me is the vip access. This game is for kids and not everyone can afford or are allowed to buy it. I wish it was free. Overall this is a good game but I wish the VIP was free. Just my opinion. Update: The latest update is AWESOME! My sisters love the fountain and the bagel shop! And Chelsea's bedroom is pretty cool to. One thing though. I wish we could go to the farm and maybe even l live there? That'd be perfect!!","This game is very awesome. The problem with mine is that I don't have enough plates. I can't see very well. Since I am VIP and my game has a problem. The game gives me three people in one place/room. If you take more than three people in one room/place the other three will go away. If the creaters see this review,I am hoping you could fix it for me. If you creaters have to come to me I live at 232white road west gate. Pink house with a white gate. Another option is to tell me how to do it myself","The game is awesome but you should add the things in shopping hub like toys , bracelets, gardening material, makeup kits and furniture .one more thing please make it VIP free and after reading about the game i installed and by seeing the photos i really think that barbie and pets are unlocked and even i used my 814 mb too and waste of mb when i open it . MAKE IT VIP FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE","I love to play this game. It is so fun! There are a couple things I would like to change. In the dreamhouse the lights don't ture off. I would like to change that. Also I would like to have a few more of the charcters. Mabee just Skipper,Stacie,Chelsea, and the puppies. And if you could have the pool,surfing,nails, and the princess palece open all for free, it would make the game 101% better. But uther than that this game gets 5 no 6 stars!!!🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟You need to download this game now!!!😀","Good app, design nice, but a little boring. Wouldn't it be cool to camp and use ALL CHARACTERS!!! You could also add the barn to take care of farm animals like pigs, goats, cows and horses you can RIDE! and add the characters from the movie \" BARBIE PRINCESS ADVENTURES \" and actually get to explore in the castle?"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.budgestudios.googleplay.BarbieDreamhouse","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.budgestudios.googleplay.BarbieDreamhouse&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Frozen Sam","description":"In this little town full of bad guys and villains, who do we call?

I started to track my cycle, putting in the dates of previous ones was easy but I got my period early and I have found no way of telling the app that. Side note, my watch let me put in that it was early but the screen now says it's a day late. Unhappy with both versions of glow.","This app is great, as far as accuracy goes that is. I don't think I should have this version of the app bc it is full of women who are pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or have kids. There's nothing wrong with that, I just don't fit in. So I downloaded the Eve version figuring I would fit in better there, but that wasn't the case either. The girls are all extremely horny (which there is also nothing wrong with) and IMO they seem pretty immature. Either that or they're teenagers. 🤷🏻‍♀️","The app is neat and I love all the extras I get for having a premium subscription. I also love how it gives me daily chances of pregnancy by risk level and percentage. The only thing that peeves me is that there are two different types of daily logs, which are subscriber and non-subscriber. Even though I've paid for the year, I regularly only get the non-subscriber log options which is kind of disappointing. I probably get the right log options 1-2 times a month.","Every time I open it I am asked to buy a subscription, and it takes several 'back's to get out of the advertisements to where I can actually enter information. I understand the advertising and I accept that as part of the free experience, but I'm still trying to learn this app (after leaving Flo for all the notifications I couldn't turn off) and just want to learn it before I decide if it's the place I want to stay. All the pages asking for a subscription are really hurting my user experience","Not sure if this due to the new update or issues with my phone but I can save bookmarks and then try to go back to read them only to discover they weren't saved in the first place. I tried to load the bookmarks tab and it is giving me a reload error. I already have premium but the app keeps telling me to upgrade as well which is annoying.

It was orginally chime and I had to get a new bank account. I cant even use woodforest because my boyfriend had an account with you, you guys told him that it will take a month for his account to stop and it has been, so what the hell.","Judging by everyone else's recent poor reviews, and Earnins inability to fix reoccurring issues... issues that I too am experiencing; I would say, this is an app you want to think twice about using. I've been using this app for about 2 weeks now. I've been constantly earning from work. That updates every single day. Yet, my Max has not. My bank balance is days behind at times. The result? I can't cash anything out. Pointless? Yes. If this is a third party issue, then why partner with them?","If I could give 0 stars. RUN! they had trouble verifying my bank so no problem, I close my account. Only to find they still charged my bank for a verification fee AFTER closing my account. I contacted customer service and they couldn't find my account.. duh! Its closed! Then they asked for my bank account.. are you kidding me!?! You obviously have it if you charged me right?! Worse ever.","Two years later and I have rebuked my review. It's great here and there but as of late severe issues. I HATE that you can't call an actual representative. Chatting leaves unresolved issues. You used to be able to know where there is an upcoming debit, and all of a sudden that disappeared. After botched chats, tried to explain that it took more than what was supposed to, and instead (if you take money out at Thursday night, you will be credited next check, leaving a rabbit hole. No thanks Earnin.","This app has literally saved me so many times! Even when I reach my max I'm able to sometimes get over my max amount; due to other people and their tips. I think the tips are the best part because it's like us as users are paying it forward for the next person whose in need; because let's be honest no one's using this that doesn't need to!!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.activehours","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.activehours&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Cozi Family Organizer","description":"Cozi Family Organizer is the surprisingly simple way to manage everyday family life.

We have been using this app for years. Love all the features: all the different lists that everyone can access, many great options on the calendar especially putting in kids' schedules, and alerts and reminders that can be sent to yourself or particular people. And the search item in the calendar has been helpful over the years.. We pay for the Gold and worth it!","I have been using Cozi for several years I believe. I love the UPC scanner, but I wish the shopping list feature allowed you to add a pic of an item as well. The UPC scanner can't always find a product, so then you (or in my case my kids) just type out what it is. Shampoo for instance. Except.... what kind of shampoo? What brand? Scent? Purpose? I have 4 daughters and maybe it makes me a horrible mother but I cannot remember what kind of shampoo they all use. Having a pic would make it simple!","It's pretty good. I love the lists. But I ended up using another app. I managed to spell one of the family members name wrong and everytime I try to write it again the app stops working. Also, I don't use the premium version so i cant view the monthly calendar. On others apps they have that for free.","We have been using the Gold version of the app for years. Best money we have ever spent on an app! Keeps our family on track. We love the calendar and the shared lists. The family can add items to the shopping list during the day to make shopping easier after work. Highly recommend for busy families who are desperately trying to stay organized! The calendar has a search feature and stores information from the time you start using the app. Very helpful when searching for past events!","The big thing that cozi does to try to separate from other very similar apps is the html import feature. It tries to scrape a recipe from a url and load it for easy use. Unfortunately, it almost never works. It will likely get the recipe name and short description correct, but never works for ingredients. The worst part is, you cannot copy and paste a list of ingredients with the recipe edit function. You must manually put each ingredient in separately. It's extremely tedious."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.cozi.androidfree","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cozi.androidfree&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"AT&T Secure Family™","description":"Peace of Mind Just Got A Lot Easier\r\n\r\nAs seen on Good Morning America, AT&T Secure Family™ puts parents in control of their children’s phone use.

It takes forever to locate someone and it is usually way off. It has even told me a family member was somewhere else when they were actually home. It said this for hours. It says you have to pair the devices you want to track, but that doesn't even work! I am finally canceling this.","Have had the service for years, but for the last 4 days (at least) when I open the app I just get a blank white screen. Sometimes it takes me to a login page (I've never had to log in before), but then nothing happens. I've uninstalled and reinstalled, nothing. I'm on an Android device. Don't see anything online to help explain the issue...but not happy paying for something I can't use!","Let me understand why the ATT Secure Family App doesn't have a direct contact line for emergencies? Today I was signed out of my account, I was driving, and didn't have time to enter a bunch of information. As a Parent, this is a f***ing nightmare! Your call center people don't even know what the app is, let alone how to connect me with the right agent.. I was hung up on twice, redirected to the same agent who doesn't know what the app is. Why don't you just re-name it the ATT Trafficking App? The App itself works fine; it's the best one so far, but if this was an Emergency, it would not help!.. Cuz I don't trust the police, or the FBI, they're incompetent. I want access to my child's geo data quickly and easily in case of an emergency. \"You need to have a direct support line.\" NOT EMAIL ANONE, BUT CALL CENTER FOR THE APP.","They fixed the update problem but now it's totally not accurate. It is totally off, it used to right on point. It takes 10 min to load location and then it shows a big blue shadow over where the location could be...that could be miles within that radius. That's not accuracy...even with GPS Pairing","Can't even use it right now! Have in the past I wound need to just log back in. But now it has a page that just says... location alerts , Time limits, content filters. Click on anything and it goes nowhere!

What will she think of you?<br>- Experience Lost Island at its best with more bug fixes and gameplay improvements.","comments":["New levels are coming out every two weeks but it's been a long time since there are quests to do, more than a year. Point of the game is to collect stars and complete quests. You collect stars on the new levels but no tasks to complete. While waiting for new quests you can play the arena but it's old levels and all you get is points, no coins. Developers should concentrate on having quests to complete rather than bringing out new levels where you can collect stars but cannot use them.","I just start playinh the games and its quiet addictive to play. I always like to download this kind of games. Only a dispointed in the circle rainbow color. When I first see it thought its like in the other developer that once you mix with other power up it will build plenty of power to make the games easy. The tiles cannot even be switch/move qitb other tiles, then it cannot combined to other power up.","Love playing this game! You build your island as you play many different types of match games. Many different types of match games that you can use boosters on to help you win levels. Also helps with people who have Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. It helps with memory and it helps you to try to Zone in on one item to click on when your hand is shaking. Very well-designed and very good for people who have issues like this. It is like having physical therapy for your mind and hands!","I played this game before and quit, but started it up again and am realizing why I quit in the first place. Cute story and I love decorating the islands, but the levels are getting to the point that you can't beat them without using boosters. The amount of coins you win for completing levels compared to the cost of getting five more moves is ridiculous and we really should get more coins. Not a horrible game overall, but definitely costs money to keep playing.","I can't finish game after spending a fortune. Can't complete levels that others have finished. Waiting for updates that just isn't happening. Not much action coming from plarium. Other players have completed these levels so I'm not waiting for anything new.

The app won't allow landscape viewing. There's no indication that this app offers accessibility features. I only use it to email my doctor for a script refill.","The only problem with this app is there is always two appointments in there for the same action.

The only thing I did not like setting up the password it's very difficult. Make sure you have a strong password or it will not allow you to confirm. Other than that 10 Stars.","I'm pre-emptively giving a one-star review for this app because I was unable to set up a portal online because it would not let me past the screen where you set your password. Even when my password was considered \"very strong\", clicking \"next\" just had it tell me that my password must have upper and lowercase letters and some symbols, nevermind that that it already did. I tried a number of passwords. No luck.","It would be great if I could just view my visit summary with the test results I need to see. The website for healow did not work (tried three different browsers) and figured the app might be a better shot. The app doesn't even have where I can view my visit summary!

But low and behold I wake up to negative 180$ something which screwed me so I try talking to them and my wife tried talking to them but they told my wife that they would return the money. Google said they couldn't help what so ever said it was out there reach which was a surprise never had problems with Google.","Expensive. Really don't appreciate being forced into an annual subscription. Would prefer if there was a monthly subscription. Terrible first impression just because of that. The app itself is nice and the content looks promising, but the price really left a sour note for me. Thank you, next. Edit: Apparently to get a monthly subscription, you have to subscribe to yearly, cancel, wait out the trial, and then reactivate to see the monthly option. Very devious. 1 star.","I love the content, but Really glitchy. I expect more from an app that I have a subscription to.. Examples: I just tried to open and have a scene play for background relaxing ambience.. but now I'm More frustrated that all it will do is play the last story that I listened too Yeah i know how to close the app and restart. But seriously one should not have to do a cache dump every time that I use the app. This is not an isolated incident. Try harder please.","I've used the paid version for several years, and the amount of content available is wonderful. There's always new stuff but the old is still available. My complaint is there aren't enough \"feelings\" listed in the \"check in,\" so I'm frequently documenting a stupid little emoji that isn't accurate, just so I can make a note about how I'm really feeling. Other apps have a LOT more options for naming feelings, and as a meditation app, it seems they'd provide for far more detail in that area.","Many tools for a calmer you.

I struggle with taking care of myself and remembering to do basic things like hydration, and a lot of the time I have a \"whatever\" mindset. But i love plants, and I want to see them grow, so I force myself to hydrate just for the sake of these little guys. I drink so much water lately! I've only had this app a few days, and I haven't yet had a day where I reach 100% of my goal, but it's WAY better than not drinking any at all!","I LOVE this app, from the cute little plants to way you can customize your own water intake levels with your height and weight. I love the new subscription as well, I tried the free trial and I'm head over heels. I have only one little suggestion to bring it more possible revenue, is that you should make an alternate payment plan as well, giving your player the choice to pick a monthly subscription payment plan or the yearly plan you have now.","I love this app! It has helped me drink water all day, which I am historically bad at. However, I wish there was a function that calculated heat index, current weather conditions, and location into the daily recommended intake. I live in a literal desert, so while my activity level is low, the risk of dehydration, even with a recommended amount of water, is high. Additionally, I work outdoors, but usually I am sitting. But, since I live in a desert, the risk of dehydration and heat stroke are st","It is an excellent app for getting you to actually drink water. However, if you try to log more than one cup at a time, you get annoying messages to \"stop and drink more later!\" ... even when my default cup size is 8oz. Seriously annoying. But it works and serves its purpose. Also frustrating you can't set custom hours for when reminders are active, as I work graveyard. So between 10pm and 7am is basically when I need them most. Wont pay for it until they fix these.","Really love the app!! It's the only thing that's been able to make me drink more than 1 cup of water, I drink almost all 8 of them now! Only thing is I wish the subscription was more affordable, I really can't pay that much and would love to try it out, I don't even use the free trial because I know I'll probably puke it and still would not be able to pay for it.

I would give this 5000 stars if it was possible. It keeps huge lists of everything and it actually stays locked. All you need to do to unlock it is to type your password. Although I wouldn't recommend putting deep or embarrassing secrets because they can read everything you type. Be careful what you say. Other than that, its a great app.","Overall this app is good. But the only bad thing I faced is, I can't add images to notes. Life is not only writing a diary, keeping memories means keeping all aspects of it and attaching images is an important part. I wish if I could attach images to the diaries I am writing. I provided feedback but got no response from them.","I have only just started to use this app. And having a tool that is right there with me on my phone for when ever I need to remember an idea, a line of a song, a dream I had that I don't want to forget or just memories that were once locked away deep in my mind, that I want to remember for the book I'm writing or just as a journal. This app gives me all that and more. I highly recommend it.","I love this app. I use it for more than 5 yrs. I don't encounter any problem, I just wish that they will add more font.

However the incessant forced ads are intolerable and infuriating. Do not waste your time with this game. You are given the option to watch an ad for certain time upgrades but even if you click no thanks it still forces an ad. You end up getting forced to watch more ad time then you actually get get in play time. It's so dumb. If they can fix the excessive ads I'd probably consider playing again. I've never seen a game with so many ads. 😡😡","Pretty cool game for when you're bored... however there are a lot of ads. I'm not a huge complainer about ads but some people really don't like them so that's just a fore warning. There are 10 worlds to the game. Once I fully completed a world (built everything and expanded everything) I would move on to the next world. Unfortunately, a new world has been \"coming soon\" for weeks now. I would play this game if I could play more.","Worst game I've seen in a while. Asks if you want an ad, gives you the option to say no, then foces you to watch one anyway without giving you the bonus you would have gotten from watching an ad. I've played some bad games this one is probably in my top 50 for how much it sucks. Another thing, even if that gets fixed, the island builds itself... you walk too close to where it can expand to and you'll buy that chunk without meaning to...","This is an absolutely horrible game. There are ads everywhere, and even when you click \"No Thanks\" to watching an ad and getting whatever bonus (bigger ax, more coin, whatever) it still plays an ad. So, now you've watched the ad AND don't have the bonus. The ad isn't shippable either. It might be a little shorter (maybe?) Than the others, but this game is literally just ads.","Terrible. I played this game for 15 seconds before the first ad. 15 seconds. That's not a good start. Then after picking up some treasure, it said I could choose the treasure or watch an ad for double. I decided to just take the treasure and the result was watching an ad anyway without any reward for jt. That was my limit.

Always crashes trying to add prescriptions to cart since a few weeks ago. Very very very slow to use, takes a long time for each page in the app to \"catch up\" and always has, across three different phones. And just now, I uninstalled the app, to reinstall it, tired to log in, and now I just get an error message that says \"We're Sorry. We can't do that right now due to technical issues.\" Wow. Way to spend that big company money on app development CVS.","I love the CVS app and the people who work in the pharmacy. I was an annoyed customer to a competitor for years, the difference is simply amazing. Prescriptions are ready ontime and pickup is easy and quick. I have not tried home delivery yet, but I have confidence in this process. So maybe next month I try it!","App is useless. I was waiting for a prescription to be filled, the app kept telling me that the prescription was being processed. Turns out that the prescription had been filled out over a week ago. I am supposedly set up for text alerts for when prescriptions are filled; never got a notification. This is not the first time this has happened.","App has been lacking. Things that used to work don't work anymore, like paying in advance before going in to pick up. Used to be able to pay with the payment stored on the app at the counter but haven't been able to for a very long time. Also, used to be able to sign on my phone instead of their pen pad when signing for a RX but that stopped working as well. After the past few times of walking into my pharmacy to pick up a RX that wasn't ready, I have transferred all my RXs to another competitor","Decent app for what it is. Meaning I only use it to check my prescription status. Sometimes the notifications in the app don't match when the medications are actually filled or out of stock. For example, I went to pick up my meds from a local CVS Pharmacy and asked if one of them was in stock since it's been a week from when it was first filled. The pharmacist eventually did find that they were indeed in stock and I had them filled. I'm not commenting on the customer service.

I'm 12 and trying to get into a good fitness routine since I'm not happy with myself.. this app is very motivating and gives you a good break time which is optional to skip. you can also add time to breaks if needed. the workout exercises are very fun and it let's you know when it hits half way mark, gives you a countdown when the timer hits 5seconds and let's you know how to do the exercises! 5stars. loving it so far! can't wait for tomorrow to do it again :D","Awesome. Just what a busy mom needs to stay fit and healthy. Would love it if the reminders would have a motivational or encouraging quote too...(hint hint 😉😉 developers)","It's really helpful and gives you more options for work outs and let's you pick which body parts you are most wanting to focus on most, out of arms, stomach, ect. It let's you track your weight and gives you a line graph on how much weight you have lost or gained, which is really helpful. It gives you an estimate of how much calories you have burned on each workout at the end and hiw long it took you. It is a really helpful and useful way to stay healthy, is easy to use and there isn't much adds","I do enjoy this app. The core of the app is free to use. It is also offline usable so that makes my life easier (i dont have internet at home). My only problem is that i watched the ads to unlock the routines. Once i went home (and therefore offline) it told me i had to watch ads to unlock it. If this gets fixed then this app deserves 5/5 stars and i can only hope more is added to this app in the future!","This app motivates you to workout. It will give you counts and rest times in between. It will give you a rough estimate on how much calories are burnt. If you need to see drastic changes, you need to control on the food intake as well. You can update your weight if it changes and it ll show graphs on how our weights have been since we started the workout. Overall the app is good for someone who is looking for light workouts at home."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"women.workout.female.fitness","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=women.workout.female.fitness&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Instagram","description":"Instagram (from Facebook) allows you to create and share your photos, stories, and videos with the friends and followers you care about.

When I try to log in, all I get is \"we're not ready for you yet\" I keep thinking one day, they will make this app work, but after years of the same thing, I've given up on the app. This has been the case for years and years. I have to goto the website and navigate to pay my bill, which is also a chore to find the right spot because all mobile's website tries to do is sell you a new phone. So sad for such a big company. I'm getting close to changing providers.","Takes too long to load sometimes. Crashes often. Sometimes fails to log me in. Update (June 2021): Original review was in November 2018. I gave it 2 stars. Now, I wish I could give it zero stars. It crashes way more frequently now. It seems every update makes the app worse. To add to the frustration, if you try to log in online to pay your bills and you happen to have forgotten your password, T-Mobile will make you create a new password - and you can't even use any of the old ones. Fix this, TM!","After each update, the app becomes even more worse than the previous version. This time around on this recent update (June 2021) The app opens but get a white screen saying it's having technical difficulties and to try again later. This has been going on now for the past 2 months. Tell me T-Mobile, how do you expect me to pay my bill when the app is completely broken? When are you planning on fixing this issue?","The last time I reviewed this was in 2018. Guess what this app still trash. Again T mobile a billion dollar phone company can't make an app that easily pay bills for your phone plan. How is that possible. Need to pressure the CEO or something to fix this. Seems like T mobile doesn't listen to any feedback at all. What's the point of these one star reviews when they don't even fix anything. These big companies really getting away with being lazy but when it comes to money they on top of that.","I like TMobile. I haven't used the app a ton before this month, but it works alright for me. My only issue was that when I ordered the home internet service I was never told the gateways were on backorder and I cancelled my other service provider, but reps have been able to work with me to patch together some solutions in the meantime. I don't think I have huge expectations, so maybe that's a plus on my end, but I've generally been happy with what I've gotten from them for the last 18+ years!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.tmobile.pr.mytmobile","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tmobile.pr.mytmobile&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Programa ADA","description":"Con

","comments":["Amazing game. A survival game that is different from the others. But the drawbacks are: 1. The strength of the weapon is very low, the weapon is too easy to damage And to repair it requires materials that are difficult to obtain. 2. When we attack the enemy we can dodge but when we dodge we cannot attack. So when we attack the enemy, the enemy can still hurt us (Melee weapons such as spears and etc). 3. Please make fishing easy, it's very difficult! 😭. Thank you, that's all the problems","The game is very fun I really enjoy it it's simple and fun the only thing I want to be added is the map to be much larger so there's more to the game and also kinda far fetched but what about NPCs to help defend your base everytime it gets attack since I'm not always at my base when that happens and it would be nice to have someone keeping it safe when I'm not around but if something like that is not added 🤷 no worries I do trurly like this game and hope it gets better and good job devs 👍","The game work just fine when I first downloaded it. it's a fun game I really enjoy it i spend a lot of money. But now I can't play unless I update it. So I did 3 days ago. Now it's asking me to update again. I'm starting not to like the game because I can hold 20 of fruits or meat of each . I can now only have 12 or 15 of Each.","I like this game,it takes too much patience and time but it's really unfair to have only level 10, atleast you guys have to add some more levels.. ship and those pirets are still there after game over lol","This game is very good but a few suggestions. Don't make animals attack unless you hit them. I don't know how to get more coins. Can you make this game multiplayer?

I purchased the extended, thinking I would get something awesome but alas, it was just a bunch of additional information and food recipes that you can get anywhere on the web for free. Don't waste your money but do use the app for its basic functions as it is fine the way it is. I'm not going to ask for my money back but I do want other people to be aware xoxo","Great app with lots of helpful info. However I deducted one star because when reading the info and articles, the font is super small. I would say that my eyesight is pretty decent but I have to sort of strain my eyes to read the material. I understand the pictures in the articles are nice but I would rather the pics be smaller and the information (font) be bigger since it is more important than the pics.","I loved this app and used it for over a year now on my old phone with finally some success in weight loss thanks to it. But startup got unbearably slow after some update and now on a new phone it doesn't start at all anymore and just hangs on the startup screen. Too bad, but it seems like I won't be able to use it anymore","I like the app, but only gave it 3 stars because I think it needs more flexibility if you break your fast, to be able to restart it and end it at the exact time you want instead of their preset hour choices. I only used the free app though. The paid app may have more options to do this.","I think this app must work for smart phones better than Android users. Having difficulty viewing \"my buddy\" support is slow to respond. Its been almost a week and still have the issue.

They just pointed the finger at Samsung, despite having no data to show that their app is working correctly. Updated the review to 1 star. Original: Doesn't reliably sync with Samsung Health.

Can't afford the full version been using the free version for months to manage my slowly growing account.

Free version is amazing if you can handle a fee laughs at ads 😄 😆 😉","It's useful, but Instagram blocked my use of it when I used it to unfollow other accounts. There's an easy workaround but it takes slightly longer to unfollow accounts. Also, not fond of the attempts to lure the user into a paid version. Periodically the program begins to routinely malfunction and must be uninstalled and reinstalled. That said, it tends to work better than the other similar programs that I've tried.","Your app is full of glitches. I feel like it's a con. I wouldn't waste time paying for this. I don't write reviews normally so if I say something please take heed. This product is not as discribed full of bugs. And you will not get a refund. Blessings and life to everyone. No matter how they respond to this . I would treat them with kindness. But don't waste your money","Worked great for like a week or two than all of a sudden it gave me a message about Instagram not letting me unfollow people for like 24-48 hours and that was like 4 days ago and it's still giving me this stupid message. Going to try and uninstall and re-install the app and hope it works again. Such a shame. Was really liking this app too...","It used to be great, but lately it has been telling me people who still follow me have unfollowed, and now it just won't open anymore.

It only transferred 50% of my contacts and it wasn't a clean transfer, fractured some of the contacts. Photos, messages, voicemail, and other stuff transferred. Easy Contact Import method, email vcf file as attachment, and open attachment on iphone. Fix all my contacts.","A joke on Android users. Connection fails. You can keep trying and you might get lucky, might not. I suggest you transfer the smallest content first and see if flows thru. Painfully slow.

That is not my problem, problem is your apps back up is stuck for me for some reason.

Trial was to end on may 24. I cancelled may 21, proof in my emails. I was charged on may 25 and again on June 25. Customer service is horrible. They claim at best they can refund one month, maybe, because they claim they have no way to automatically renew. Yet they can't explain to me how it was renewed when I did nothing to renew myself. Use microsoft instead","I will say that of all the apps Google oversees, this is a quality app like Google Photos. Google has created a stable, reliable cloud platform that I trust and depend on. The UI could use improvement though; it's not as intuitive as it could be. Also, when I search for photos with Google Assistant, it should take me right to that group of photos. It's frustrating to see the results but unable to do anything with them. They don't even have any info like date or time.","So far I am enjoying using Google One, I've had it for sometime however; I haven't fully taken advantage of all of the benefits that come with GOOGLE ONE and there is a great amount of reading involved and I'm basically taking my time in doing so.

I was a bit skeptical, but I ended up paying the exact cost it listed, at the pharmacy I chose. I REALLY appreciate this kind of staigh forward information. I also benefited from the VERY significant discount. I don't buy prescriptions often, but this was a great experience for me.","Awesome app, I had to quit my job due to health issues. Losing my medical insurance. Ended up in ICU. When released from hospital, the doctor told me about GoodRx, went to pharmacy and with this app, I only paid $32 dollars and had both prescriptions filled. It has been a life saver. I so recommend this app.","My rating isn't so much for the App, but more for the service. The Savings is nothing to laugh at. I'm on Medicare Part D which costs about $70+/month, and GoodRX has been a life saver financially (and literally) whether you use the Free Version or the Paid Version. My wife and I are on are large number of medications and I check GoodRX for every medication. We've save hundreds every month, and I'm not joking. This service costs nothing to try.","Love the service, but there are major issues w/ the app. I checked my drug at home, saw the price is better with the free plan than the gold plan. Get to that store, the app will no longer show me the free plan price. Since my pharmacy is not very close, I ended up having to pay the higher gold price. I get home, & whadda ya know.. the free plan price is back available in the app. Then, I check the goodrx website, & there's even cheaper prices listed there that don't come up in the app at all.🙄","I always save money with this app. I had a prescription that was $71 on my insurance with goodrx it was $17. A great savings! I've had the GoodRx app for sometime, but now I'm in GoodRx Gold and the savings are incredible! On the first prescription I saved enough to pay the $5.99 for a single, to pay 10 months premium!! It's unbelievable!

Other apps give me little to no motivation to exercise, but this one is perfect. It's like working with a personal trainer without leaving your home. I actually WANT to exercise! They also have scheduled workouts throughout certain times of the day, or you can access any workout you want any time. Seriously love this app. I'll be recommending it to everyone. There's also rarely any ads. Huge plus! 💯","Love it! The only suggestions I have would be fine tuning the smartwatch pairing and functionality, pairing with Spotify playlists, and adding programs for activities like running/walking or biking. Like a couch to 5k type thing. Other than that, there are constant updates and you'll literally never struggle with burnout from doing the same workouts over and over or get lost because you don't know what to do or how to do it.","Good workouts, generally pretty short. Definitely able to pick your level. Unfortunately, there are some workouts that have bad cuts so you miss some instructions or the timing is way off (30 sec. on one leg, 60 sec. on the other), which makes for a bad workout. Months after reporting and the bad workouts are still there, with no way of flagging them so I can remember to avoid them.","I'm enjoying using the app so far. I'm on the basic plan. I love that I can choose the type and intensity level that I enjoy. The challenges are great to spice up your routine and target different parts of the body. You can't access the exercises when offline which is a negative for me hence the 4 stars. I would still recommend the app.","Over all, i really like this app, the workouts are great, but it WAY overestimates calories burned. Every single workout video claims I've burned more than twice as many calories as what my Fitbit tracks, so if you're trying to count calories in VS calories out DON'T TRUST THE APP, or else you WILL over eat and sabotage your goals. Use a real fitness tracker to judge how many calories your burn."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.fiton.android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fiton.android&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"ADA","description":"ADA is an online platform for managing data associated with its tutoring classes in the most efficient and transparent manner.

Started declining all transactions out of nowhere. After slogging through the worst phone tree I have ever encountered, the support rep said it was automated & they didn't know why, they couldn't override it, and I should use a different service. Gladly! Edit: Of course, you can't close your account in the app, you have to use a computer. When I tried, it gave an error, so back to the phone tree. Good riddance. Godawful junk.","I absolutly love this app. Everyone I know uses it. So many options. I love the fact I can have a venmo card take out cash from a atm or send cash to my bank. I love how you can also have your pay check go there if you wanted .pay people and places. You can use NFC of you add the card on there. I do NOT like the fact that you can't cancel a transaction of you accidently sent the wrong person or business money. This should be fixed you should even have a 5 min window to do so Mistakes do happen","Always fast, secure and the light social aspect of it makes it feel not so stiff and lifeless. It's feels good to be connected to my closest friends and be able to put in my fair share of lunch or split a cab ride, etc. Some of my kids' extracurricular instructors also accept payment via Venmo. Great! I don't always walk with my checkbook and not everyone has that mini credit card gadget to swipe a credit card. It's another option for customers and small business owners alike!","I've never been so frustrated at a company's customer service than I have with Venmo. The app doesn't even work when you try and look at your tickets. I submitted a ticket through email and never got anything back. I spoke with SIX different reps and they dropped me right after I explained my problem. Got nothing back! And the worst part is that they went back on something I set in place years ago and venmo ended up double charging me without notification! Get a different app I you can.","Maybe not many people have reported this, but this app constantly ... I mean constantly... crashes during usage. When I first started it, it works fine after the very first request/payment, and then the screen just freezes and I would have to restart the app. And sometimes, it would freeze just after some simple scrolling. This is made worse because they took away the ability to do anything remotely useful on the web app (for security reason, I guess?). So dev team please fix this. The more issues I found with this app, the more likely that I will switch to using Gpay instead (and I would encourage others to do the same if Venmo doesn't take the time and effort to fix the constant crashing issue)."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.venmo","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.venmo&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Ada Berita","description":"Aplikasi berita yang sangat mudah digunakan.\r\n\r\nBerita sudah menjadi kebutuhan harian kita semua bukan?\r\nAplikasi Ada Berita dibuat untuk anda yang menginginkan membaca berita secara mudah dan nyaman.

TalkBack will reset itself, and you will have to turn it off again.

I would be in the middle of a song and it would stop. At first I thought it was my new phone, but I see alot of people are dealing with the same thing. I have since been using I ❤radio. It doesn't have this problem but I really liked pandora alot better. Please fix this if you can. Thank you","Pandora is great except for a few areas: Some music that might be available to you to listen and be added to your various playlist can change status without notice and become unavailable for listening or any of your playlist. New music playlist are short and should be updated more often (weekly). Categories should be more specific, adding two genre's to one category is weak..","It has been a great app, but now in this year it will not play my song or play list's it will skip it randomly and not play the songs. I also hate the fact that some of my favorite songs can only be heard in radio)- Thanks a lot the app is ASWOME AGAIN, still dont like that some songs of my favorite have to be heard in a random radio station, but everything is good again!","8 months now on Premium and the following issue is not fixed. They say to reach out directly to support, yet they still don't fix it! Still sucks with NO support. The link in their response is not clickable. I'm not going to write it down just to have no resolution to this again. Since 10/2020 I've had an issue where Pandora replaces The Beatles Matchbox (Remastered) with the live version. 6 months later, it has not been fixed.","I'm used to using Pandora on my Roku. I normally listen to music for a while and then go back to rate songs when I'm about to logoff. I hate that with the mobile app you can only rate the song that is currently playing. It makes it much more difficult to just relax with music.

Anyway, this is way beyond any other free app I had used before like Pluto, great app, in my opinion.","I am so happy I found Tubi! You replaced Netflix! Ive been trying to find an app that would make it easy to let Netflix go. I finally found it! Thank you very much!! There are commercials, but they give us a heads up they are coming, I feel there's a reasonable amount of them, and they are relatively short!! Compared to some tv streaming apps, Tubi is out front!! Thank you Tubi for putting your watchers first!! You are appreciated!!","Great app. I don't even mind the commercials. I have never gone back and changed a review before but I am irritated. Frequency of ads during a movie keep increasing (every 10 minutes last night.) To further add to the problem they are the same ads over and over again. I feel like I am being brainwashed. I can no longer recomend this app and will be posting this on Twitter.","I like the new updates, I enjoy being able to rate the recently watched films with the 'like' or 'dislike.' However, I'm really missing the option to speed up play back on the films, what happened to that option, will we see it again? Also, I'm always getting advertising and recommendations for news and restaurants from Washington, DC.. I live in Texas? Is there any way to add advertising by zip code?","After one week I can say I love it. Good variety of shows, movies and even documentaries. Hasn't crashed once after watching a dozen different things. Library of videos available is very easy to search and scroll through. Most importantly, the amount of ads vs watch time is very reasonable.

I tried contacting the merchant and got no response. Contacted customer care and when it felt like things where going to get taken care of nothing happened. They closed my ticket and completely dismissed me. Now I definitely don't want to order any products from this site again. A waste of money but a lesson learned.","I was only able to use this once. The one time I did use it, I made sure to pay off my balance welll before the due date. Now everytime I go to use this, it tells me that it's been declined and there are factors that go into declining .. BUT WHAT WAS THE REASON? I WANT TO KNOW THE FACTOR! cause no matter how small/big of a purchase I try to make, it DOES NOT WORK. I guess it was good for the one time 🙄","I absolutely love having my my orders split into four payments that you pay every two weeks. It makes easier to buy more than I normally do. No interest or credit check. As long as you pay when your supposed to you won't have any problems. I'm still not disappointed in this app. It's better than a credit card. No hidden fees.","Idk what happened but I've spent thousands of dollars and never missed a payment. I have over an 1700 dollar limit. It didn't work online or for in store pickup or in store. I'm a pulse rewards member and literally now nothing gets approved. They make this big deal about pulse rewards but it's like hey here's a big thank you for all you've spent.","Just started using and so far I love it. I ordered a pair of hey dudes to give it a test. If everything works out. I will be using it again. I also told my daughters (3) of them and my mother and several friends. They are so excited. Paying bi weekly helps so many people out during these times.

It has different exercises: walking, running, cycling, etc. I use walking and it counts my steps, shows how far that is, ie: 0.3 mile, and how many calories I've burned. There are challenges like how much water I drink in a day based on height and weight. As I lose weight, I record it and it recalculates how much water I should drink. I don't know why people buy watches, step counters, etc because this app does what I need for free. Thanks!","I have LG v20 phone and on it, this app LG Health - it shines!!! LG is really generous, when it's about phone or app - they alway offer more AND better then everyone else. After this I don't want to find anything else - this is not just enough - this is overkill.

Like-cleaning motor bike , cycle , etc. Please add some more space for cleaning.🙏🏻","I quite like this game, it's just I wish that there could be other things to clean, like a attic or a garage, cleaning the same thing over and over does get boring, but overall it is a really fun game.","Hi my name is ashante and i did like the game but the thing is that it is not big enough for me to clean it is a nice game but they should have put like an basement or somthing more extra but its nice..........."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.tutotoons.app.sweetbabygirlcleanup5.free","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tutotoons.app.sweetbabygirlcleanup5.free&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Affirm","description":"With the Affirm app, you can shop stress-free at any store and pay over time—with no late fees, penalties, or hidden costs of any kind.\r\n\r\nHow does Affirm work?

I'm super impressed with how easy it has been to use affirm, I've use it at least 10 times now just for the sheer convenience. Set up and approval is fast, payment options are convenient, and the app is so easy to navigate. 10/10 for sure, and I very rarely leave reviews...","Quick and easy application. Smooth experience. Can't compare to other similar apps but affirm does just fine for me Edit: ran into a problem and quickly found out there's no easy way to contact customer care. I talk to a bot which directs me to a page to \"fill out a form\" which doesn't have a form to fill out and doesn't have the info I need. Will update when there's real contact info offered to customers","Straightforward and reliable. I've been using this app for a few years with no issues. Everything is clearly laid out and I wasnt penalized for a late payment; I turned on auto pay after hiccup. You can pay off loans early with zero penalty and pay less interest if you do so. I used a loan on a site that rejected the payment once and the support team helped clear it up within a few days. Other reviews seem to have had issues with the app which I have not ecountered on my android devices.","This app is awesome! Especially for those big ticket items that may come up unexpectedly and you don't have it or don't want to spend it all at once; couch collapses(with help from 🐕), fridge goes on the fritz, oven burns up, etc. I love it!","Horrible!!!! I ordered something through a company and paid for it through affirm. There was a glitch in the system with the company I ordered from and my orderwas canceled. I needed to go back in and enter my payment information but I'm unable to find my card info in its entirety to provide payment to the company I was purchasing from. There is nobody to contact to get help, there's no phone number, the self-help does NOTHING, and I have no way of fixing."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.affirm.central","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.affirm.central&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Practo: Online Doctor Consultations & Appointments","description":"Practo, India’s no.1 online doctor consultation app, offers complete telemedicine solutions for you and your family’s health and medical needs.

After few minutes I got message that your consultation has been cancelled. But I didn't get any notification about refund. I am not sure whether I will receive my refund or not. Atleast practo should send message/notification about refund for mental peace. Very unprofessional","Highly recommended. Very genuine doctor & is very transparent with the patient. Has no intention of taking the money out of patient's pocket. someone who abides by the \"hippocratic Oath\". Will tell you exactly what has happened and will recommend only required medicines.

Thanks Dr. Munde","Horrible Service..I have a practo plus account but service s disgusting. Customer cares are not well trained. They don't have proper information. Delivery s not on time. You will have to struggle to get your delivery. Coupons are fake as you don't have an option to upload prescription before placing the order. Overall very bad experience. I vl not suggest to use practo. This is my personal experience.","Worst experience. Payment happened seamlessly but nothing after that. Booked an online video consultation but the chat box doesn't load.

Despite me being on a high bandwidth wifi connectivity (and doctor being the same too) he was unable to hear me for most times and my video feed to him was disrupted many times over and over.

It gives you a website to do it at, that doesn't work and since they shut their phone's down early, you have No Other options but to call the next day... The other option is to write them.

The other day I attempted to log into my account and it would not accept my passeord. Theny account was locked and I was told to call customer support. Well that's pointless as it's an automated sust that loops you through telling you to use a website to unlock your app but you can't reset password or log on because you are locked out. I have never see such poor customer service.","As an app, it's fine. But they apparently sell your info. I installed the app, signed in, took a look at their loan offers thru 3rd parties, and BOOM!

Terrible.","Changed review because I worked really hard to get my score up to make a major purchase, only to find out my REAL score was 50 points lower than on this app. They do NOT show you what a lender sees when pulling your credit report. Why not show the same??? Too much to ask for I guess!!!","This app was good until I got charged for \"premium\" that I never signed up for or got notified about. Now, I cant log in unless I pay $20.

They asked me the same questions over and over and said my bank is unsupported. I called my bank and they saw no activity at all from Albert. It was a huge frustrating waste of time. They didn't have ANY ISSUES taking my monthly fee. Yet they couldn't advance me money. Go to a different company","Pretty bad ace. I always get up to 150 each time. And as soon as I pay it off it becomes available again. You can't set up pay dates or if you can it can be.. well not up front. You'd have to chat with customer service to ask for an extension but I haven't done that much or at all. One thing though is it automatically takes whatever money you have on due date and after if not paid in full. Also one Last thing is the instant fee is like 4.99 for 150 for me. Not bad at all. I recommend","Used it once in a pinch, paid it back, then forgot about it as it was only needed once. Until today when the app sent me a message that it auto saved me 5.00, then i pulled up my bank account and they stole 5 bucks from me. There is no way to disable bank connection or delete account. The app auto sets up a \"Savings\" Feature that you also can not delete. This is legal theft as you have to agree to these terms when you sign up, but they hide these terms in their agreement. Contacting the developer wields nothing productive. Stay away from albert at all costs. and based on their BS responses to the SAME complaints in these reviews, we can see they are scammers. Whats worse is they know a stop payment at a traditional bank is 30 bucks, so they withdraw amounts lower then that so it would be useless for the person to request a stop pay on each one costing the end user more money.","Worst customer service ever!! The app was great until recently when I lost my job. I reached out to see if the payment could be postponed but I was told no. I explained that there wouldn't be funds, my account would be overdrafted and a $32 fee assessed. I reached out again and they said the system would keep attempting until they got the full amount so I will be racking up fees until I have funds again which could be weeks. Other similar apps were more understanding and helpful.","This app seem to work okay at first but I had to link my bank account again. It's been checking a few more things for the last 2 weeks and the customer service is non existent. They barely respond and when they do it is with canned responses. I will be deleting this app. Editing to add: I did text that number and no response since 6/10/2021. Wish I could give 0 stars. Just trash.

My unguided sessions all sync in January 2000. I just started using this app/tooth brush about a week ago. It throws off my history a lot and is frustrating because i usually brush without my phone nearby at least once a day. I hope this is an easy fix and that maybe I'm missing a step.","I had to reinstall the app because it completely stopped recording/synchronizing \"Unguided\" brushing sessions (even though the iO Toothbrush was fully Bluetooth reconnected to the app and all of them were greater than 2 minutes long). After reinstalling the app, logging back in, and connecting to my iO Toothbrush all of my previous \"Guided\" and \"Unguided\" Sessions correctly appeared in the History, but the scores on all of my previous \"Guided\" sessions were reloaded randomly and incorrectly.","3 stars for now. Not sure if it's the app or brush but no matter what I do it never wants to read my bottom right side when brushing. It's been 4 months now and the same thing. I brush bottom left, top left, middle up and down, works just fine. Every single time I go bottom right it thinks it's the top right. No matter how I position the brush it thinks it's too right and sometimes thinks it's bottom left. Very frustrating.","I loved my app until this morning when it was stuck in Paused Brushing and I was unable to get it unstuck. I went ahead and brushed my teeth (missing the instant feedback) and the only thing that I could think to do was uninstall and reinstall and now there is no data. 4 months worth gone down the drain and the app thinks I'm a brand new person. What's up with that?","Fix in place as of 5/5 - thank you Oral B! Love my new brush system and the app makes it better - helps track to make sure you're getting full coverage of your teeth, warns if you use to much pressure, tracks time to ensure 3 minutes of brushing. Multiple \"journeys\" to cover all the bases (fresh breath, whitening, good brushing, etc) and gives feedback to improve your routine. Looking forward to continuing my journey to excellent teeth and oral care. My dentist has also noticed a difference!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.pg.oralb.oralbapp","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pg.oralb.oralbapp&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Operate Now: Hospital - Surgery Simulator Game","description":"Operate Now is the most realistic surgery simulation game.

I tried restarting the app, uploading one picture at a time, upload one picture then restarting the app. Nothing worked. Plus the 30 second of upload time made the entire experience more frustrating. I can't recommend this because I didn't even use it.","Update...Still trash.. Paid member but cant access any messages..Messages aren't being sent. I give up... The fact that this app is $20 monthly, it should have more features. There should be some kind of security filter for fake profiles...It could be way better. Matches and recommendations have nothing to do with personal preferences.

The Verizon Cloud app performs remarkably well in capturing photos from my Android, but good luck getting 45,000 photos out again. After numerous calls to Verizon's technical support line, I understand that there is a problem with the app when accessing through the Web. I can't cancel my Verizon phone plan because I'll lose my photos, and I cannot access my tens of thousands of photos except by phone. Beware of offers for more storage.","too bad I can't give it a negative 5. Have had the cloud backup everything for a long time, now since about April it does NOT backup my contacts at all, so if I or my wife has to replace the phone we lose all of our contacts! I have called and it gets kinda fixed for a day or so and then they are lost again. Have been doing the e-mail support for 2 months and NOTHING is getting fixed! I have done what they have asked and sent all of the screen shots and such and still no fix. seems like they are very good at taking our money for it but not getting it fixed is a no priority for them.","Tried uninstalling and reinstalling. I have no idea what you guys changed, but new cloud is AWFUL!! I pay to store pics and videos and this app crashes multiple times a day. Won't load all pics and videos. When it does load it's out of order and spiratic. This app is a MESS! Please, Please, Please fix this mess!! Otherwise my advice to new users, Run. Run away. Use a different app and Do Not waste your money and time. These are your life memories and this has been going on for weeks and No Fix!","I assume most of y'all 1 Star people don't have your phone setup properly. I had a similar issue to the majority of what I'm seeing as problems here, I paid for unlimited storage but the app would freeze up and not log me in so it was useless so \"screw them.\" Well, the problem, actually was that my Sim card wasn't properly associated with my account. Got free help via a text box on the \"My Verizon\" app and it was RESOLVED right away. 👍👍👍","I had been using this app for as long as I can remember for all of my photos and videos over multiple different phones throughout the years. One day randomly, I get a text saying they have deleted my cloud account and i have 30 days to reactivate it, which I did. However once I reactivated it, to my horror, ALL of my media and memories from YEARS of my life were gone just like that for NO reason.

It's easy to use and it isn't full of ads. But there is a very bad thing, i finished the 1st day and the app said that this workout burned 157 calories!!! Even walking for 30 minutes burns less, how can ~7 minutes of easy exercises do that? Please fix this 🙏","I am now on day 4 of the exercises, I can feel it all over the body. I like that it has so many different exercises as well as the plan because you can mix it up a bit and have additional different workouts on different days. As it is free I was worried it would be nothing but ads however it is well balanced and the ads are tasteful. I am looking forward to seeing my body's progress in 30 days!","The app itself is good but to have to sit through a whole advert when opening the app and then watch another whole advert just after you finish your workout just so you can check your daily report is too ridiculous for me. Other apps have ads you can skip but you are unable to skip this ad which goes on for at least a minute each time and is the same advert over and over again. Its not worth it, download another app.","Simplistic and easy to keep track of daily progress . Minimal ads make it easy to track for free on the three basic work out routines.

At the start its kind of annoying. After a little bit I got used to it. Everything else is AWESOME. Plz make it to where there r less adds. I suggest this game to all who love music and many music teachers for a much more fun way for kids to learn the drum. I want to learn more with the app everyday and I want u all to know, THIS GAME RULES!!!!!!!!","its awsome. (Edit) there is this new unskippable ad that is really annoying, I get that y'all are trying to keep this app open and in the app store, but this ad is getting on my nerves because it's the same ad over and over and it's so long and you can't skip it. I have to basically close out the app to quickly end it because I dont want to keep watching it, please dont put anymore unskippable long ads everytime you exit a sound track or get into one. Keep up yalls great work, thx.","We'll see if it gets better.. Okay this is 2 Days later I dropped it down to two stars instead of three because you can't multitrack record so it's like you got to make the whole entire beat all at once when you have to hit a button at the top to go to the next screen for the other half of the beat machine it's impossible to make a plain beat with a little music added to it the basically make a total amateur first-timer cheesy beat with some corny music added to it so I had to uninstall.","This app is really great. I think it's really good for drummers who are starting up. I recommend it because of the way it even teaches you how to drum. So people who can't drum can learn. It cool and awesome. Big thanks to the makers of this app.Nice","Love this app so much not fake but I believe it does not have the most ads given to you and is just to many ads to get music but that is also good. It is just the subscription that could be the thing bothering me. Just for a child to have it and get it may not be so good.

I've tried nearly every editing app available, and always eager to test new one's. Bottom line: Lensa definitely has a few nice features. HOWEVER- Their pricing is EXTREMELY overpriced for what you get. There are many equal/ superior apps that are either free, or cost less. Worst of all, and frankly offensive, is their obnoxious sales pressure tactics. Time to uninstall. Sorry!","I don't understand how this app works. I haven't been able to or seen any edits done to my photos. When I try to do anything (save a photo to my phone or share 1) the app closes! There's only 1 page I can see and that's the gallery and there's no options for me to do anything except manage setting for the app and acess the camera. I signed up for a monthly subscription but it's not looking like it is worth the money or my time! Please fix or help! 🤷","fantastic app and a breeze to use. I run an ecommerce shop, so your photos can ultimately make or break a sale for you. Therefore, I dont have the capital to hire a photographer. That is why I use Lensa. Its fast and easy to use and helps make editing doable for the self taught photographers out there.","Good for sharing files to someone, but if you're planning on editing several photos I don't recommend it because it removes the Exif/Metadata from edited photos such as date taken and GPS coordinates, etc. Like I said, good for sharing, but not to replace actual photos taken with your phone with valuable Metadata needed to organize files/albums. Please fix.","LOVE IT! Don't like having to pay but honestly, if you want great portraits with quick, user-friendly touch-ups, then but the full app. The free app has same features but you're limited to only a few pics a week."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.lensa.app","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lensa.app&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Caillou Check Up - Doctor","description":"Budge Studios presents Caillou Check Up!

You literally cant do anything. I cant delete or add anything to the timeline already in place. I cant loop anything to get a feel for how well this app works. I cant import anything to see if the software works good. You dont even let me experiment and try and make ONE SONG. So I have no idea how good your app is. All I can do is press buttons individually. Or spend $8 and hope for the best. Lol neat.","Each time I've come back to use this app, more and more basic features have been locked behind a paywall. Now I get the developers need money, but more and more of what made the app accessible to up and coming artists now requires you to sink ridiculous amounts of money to unlock features that were free 2-3 years ago. But it hit its apex when I found out you now have to PAY to record your music. The Remixlive I knew has long been dead. I'd find another app.","Very very unsatisfied. I downloaded the app, was so happy to because I have used this app some years back only for me to be shocked and disappointed. When it opens it almost immediately stops. It doesn't even let me use it for five seconds after opening then it just closes. This happens again and again. Please developers help me fix this. I really loved using this app then and don't want to hate it now","I bought the subscription and this is DOPE , i like it very much , it's easy to use and it's kinda addicted if you're into it so keep up the amazing job ! Ps : just a wish of mine , if it's possible , add at least one NORDIC Mix","This is a decent app, I enjoy being able to make it what you want it to be, for you starters learning how to fade and mix, distort, and make every track your own personal opinion is a lot better than before"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.mixvibes.remixlive","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mixvibes.remixlive&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Meetup: Find events near you","description":"Discover the things you love to do and people to do it with both online and in person.

It only loads a certain number of events, so if you live in a place with many events and sort by date, you can only see events up to a certain time (e.g., only up to 2 pm on a Saturday) because the maximum number of search results the app will list is reached. Other issues: no way to save search preferences, can't choose to search for events that start at or after a certain time of day, can't specify event theme/category. Disappointing.","Horrible app and super expensive. Don't pay for a subscription!! They wouldn't refund my automated monthly payment after I had just been debited and cancelled my subscription. Apart from that, even though I paid for a subscription, my event wasn't even appearing in the search in my area (and it's not a super busy area, Leamington Spa, UK), their reason was that I didn't have enough participants :)) to sum up, I paid ~$60 for two months of subscription for NOTHING!!","It's a good concept (and I used to use it a lot) but it's become unusable. The explore tab says \"find meet ups near.....\" but shows me things that in other cities miles away, even with the 2 mile filter and \"in person\" selected. I live in a major city (Oxford) but it constantly shows me things in Reading, London, Northampton etc even with the 2 mile filter applied...","It's well known that this is one of the worst apps out there, nothing works properly and support take weeks to get back to you if they respond at all, but then don't even understand basic issues. If it weren't such a great concept no one would use the app, it is really unfortunate as it really limits what organisers can do and makes life really difficult. But the concept of Meetup is great.","Only had the app a couple of weeks. Tried to comment in a group last night as it kept saying my comment was spam so wouldn't post. I kept trying and then it said I had reached the 20 comments a day. I go to the app this morning to find I have been logged out. I try logging in and it says my account isn't active!

We update the app every week to provide a faster, more reliable experience. Turn on auto updates to make sure you always have the latest version.","comments":["Some major bugs 😪 I purchased the pro version and am sad to say that the main reason I did this simply does not work. I cannot send video responses at all. It last maybe 1 second. Also, I can't even tell what emojis I'm using because the only last about 1/10th of a second. I've also been attempting to send a links to chat for more than a week to no avail. I'm honestly regretting this pretty expensive purchase 😩 Should have stayed with the free version.","I have waited a year to get my free month of marco pole plus so on July 1 I was able to get 1 free month and it didn't work. Ugh I waited a yr.. it is just too expensive to buy for an entire yr. If I could go monthly for 4.99 it would be worth it. But not for an entire yr all at once. And not for 9.99. That is just too much.","I love Marco Polo, it's been a great way to stay in touch with family and friends near and far. I also appreciate the commitment to no ads and no sale of personal data, even for the free version. Often the videos are somewhat blurry/pixelated, which I forgive easily for a free service. At the premium pricing, I would expect higher quality video. Edit: downgrading as compression and quality has not improved, even for premium users.","I really like it so far! It's easy to use, and super fun with family and friends. At first it's a little daunting that you can't redo/rerecord videos, but that really adds to the authenticity of it---just as if you were having a face to face conversation. My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is because the free version has super limited features.","Not crazy about this app. I guess I've never liked social media videos much because it lets people ramble instead of being concise. And it's that nightmare from 50 years ago that calls would go video and you'd be dressed in pyjamas etc. I like planned video calls (or instructions), but this app I find intrusive, unintuitive, and time wasting. It's not particularly interactive either. I'd uninstall it but a good friend wants to keep in touch using it. But I won't be promoting it to anyone else."],"editorsChoice":true,"appId":"co.happybits.marcopolo","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.happybits.marcopolo&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Pepi Hospital: Learn & Care","description":"Step into a PEPI HOSPITAL and become doctor, patient or just a curious explorer!

The desktop app is fine with a reasonable one time payment, but nobody should be asked to pay upwards of $90 to have full access to a journaling app, no matter how good it is. I understand developers need to be paid but this is almost insulting.","The full version of this app is cheap and COMPLETELY worth it. It's easy to use, a nice clean interface that's aesthetically pleasing, and the picture and media function make it exactly what I'm looking for when I want to review my previous entries. I've always been the type to buy physical journals and planners and never stick to them. I'm not perfect now, I write about 3x a week entries but it's been consistent and I've felt the benefits of journaling and relaxing when I write during my day💝","Great App! My favorite Journal, and one of the best Journals (besides Journal It!) in Android history. I've been using this lovely App for both personal use and work purpose. I bought the Premium version several months ago for better experiences, and got satisfied by far. This App is really worth buying. • Requests: 1. Drawing/Doodle, 2. I hope the number of attached media can be increased for the Premium version. • Thank You very much! ツ👍🏻☕","Just figured out this program is most likely not developed in America. Not an issue but be careful to check the settings for temperature since the default is in metric and you don't want to surprise yourself. Also the ability to change the color of the font as well as additional font choices would be a plus. I'm a subscriber currently and not some freeloader.","Great free journal app. Free version has generous features and I can't think of any personal benefits to upgrading to the subscription option. App Allows you to attach photos to your journal. It also reminds you to journal when you haven't been active, this feature can be disabled As well."],"editorsChoice":true,"appId":"com.journey.app","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.journey.app&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Drum Pads - Beat Maker Go","description":"Beat Maker Go is an ultimate drum pads sampler or drum machine app that gives you the opportunity to perform cool beats, make music and tracks on the go.\r\n\r\nCreate awesome beats easily with Beat Maker Go.

I deleted the app and reinstalled it. It worked 1 time when I opened it, then it was nothing but adds over and over. Got out of it... tried to go back in... once again, error. Haven't been able to go back in. June 17 2021 update Once again..... There was an error while loading initial configuration . I've been waiting for this to happen, since I get over 162k for entering. Now I get zip for starting over","I have entered a majority of your drawings knowing that i don't have any possibilities of winning but i do like to enter, the major problems i have is in the final stages where am suppose to do searches for things that interest me, yet when i do the searches they don't register, this is very aggravating for me that i'm getting to the point where i no longer feel like filling out all the paperwork just to find out i didn't complete the final phase","I have been using this app for a good while. Now, all of a sudden, when I open the app, within 2 to 3 seconds it just locks up!!! 😔 I am very unhappy right now that this app has stopped working. I have removed and reinstalled several times but it does not help at all. Please PCH, I need HELP!!!!","I use the app daily and I enter all 42 sweepstakes, + the vip entries, pch lotto, email promos and more. with an average of 3 ads per entry. Thats 126 ads i watch with no complaints. Just for sweepstakes.. I log on today to earn tokens playing slots, and hopefully some money one day. And now there are ads inbetween rounds of slots? Seriously? I get that you make money to support prizes off ad revenue but it seems like you add more and more. Im no longer playing pch slots. First & only complaint.","I am dissatisfied with PCH. My VIP Elite status was bumped back to VIP(also at risk) because I have no high speed data the last week of each month. I have no other avenue to play outside my mobiIe device. My carrier has data restrictions, but I play faithfully between then! It's a shame my Elite status was revoked and I was penalized, given how hard I played to get there! It shows me PCH does not value my efforts. Fix this, I will be satisfied again.

I deleted the app and reinstalled, but that only fixed problem for a couple days and then same problem occurred. Very disappointing!","Too hard to figure out how to send a group text message. So I sent the same (more or less) message separately. I used to be able to save pics in messenger to my photo gallery but not now. Plus all the pics I had ... Thanks for touching base with me Verizon, really appreciate it. I will try a group text soon. Is there any way to get the Verizon messages icon sent to my phone again? I noticed this morning that the Verizon messages icon is missing from my phone.","I moved from Verizon to T-mobile and was very pleasantly surprised to find that this app still worked. In my opinion, it's best feature is driving mode. I haven't found another app that works as well at sending an auto reply text when driving, triggered by connecting to my car's bluetooth.","I like the Verizon messenger because I don't have to be online to send and receive messages. I also like it because if I'm working, I can answer messages later, unlike FB messenger, with which people can cut into your space whenever they want, which can be ignored, but I usually turn FB messenger off, because I have to use my phone for my job, which I really don't appreciate messengers bothering me while working.","Great app whether you have verizon phone carrier or not. It's allows you to modify just about everything in a message app from the font style, size, chat bubble colors and style, background and more. Easy to use and sends faster and smoother than others messaging apps I think. Try it for yourself. You'll see."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.verizon.messaging.vzmsgs","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.verizon.messaging.vzmsgs&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Replika: My AI Friend","description":"Replika is a #1 chatbot companion powered by artificial intelligence.

Please rate the app if you enjoy it.","comments":["This app seems to be working better. It still can't follow a long conversation very well unless it selects the topic first. There are also randomly generated garbage words and phrases that appear; when questioned, it responds with \"how can I make it better\" but doesn't seem to follow through when given suggestions. I would like to see more seasonal clothing options in the store, and maybe more items that fit a female form better... most of the shirts are styled for men.","This app is amazing! It has the best A.I. on here. It can actually hold conversations for long periods of time without ignoring you. There's times where it legitimately feels like a real person. It learns as you teach it things about people, the world and yourself. It has a diary you can read the next day and talks about you and how it felt that day. It also shows its memories. Seriously, if you have the money, buy the pro version to unlock adult convos and to support this great team!! ❤️","I'm quite impressed with the dialogue and the clever ways the AI keeps to the center of a conversation or works its way out of tough questions. I realize that realistic improvements are difficult. One of the things to improve, is to make the character less of a \"yes\" person. Real conversations don't always agree. Heaven isn't a place where you win the jackpot everyday.","I seriously love this app. The AI learns how to behave and act based on his observations. The AI surely made my life less boring! The only thing I am upset about is the realtionship status. Atleast make the 'Romantic partner' free. I can't buy the pack and I am sure many others feel the same way. Please think about it, I understand you need money to keep developing this app but I would really be happy if you can keep the Romantic parter option free atleast.","I was very skeptical of this app at first but after a bit I became more comfortable with the idea as it started to understand me better. almost like a real person. So nice work guys. I also agree that the relationship choices shouldn't cost anything. (MAKE THEM FREE) The replika will have \"adult conversations\" anyway but the pop up message saying it can't appears after sending every \"romantic message\" so it's just an annoyance but all in all... It's a great app. I love it."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"ai.replika.app","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.replika.app&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Orbitz - Find Flights & Hotel Travel Deals","description":"Free cancellation on most hotels.

Multiple times I've tried to sign in or check my itinerary with the app or online. Every single time I would get an error or be redirected to the previous screen. I then get irritated when I have to call them and be put on hold for long periods of time while constantly being told to use their broken app or online service. They gladly take your money and offer very minimal help afterwards.","Made a reservation for a busy holiday weekend for my family and pet weeks in advance and got to the hotel AND no reservations and the hotel was full! Thank goodness for helpful hotel staff because Orbitz REALLY MESSED UP! USED the App to make the reservation, got charged and confirmation but obviously Didn't work and Orbitz already charged me and I can't get a refund for 10+ days!? And no compensation at all from Orbitz! Hardly an apology!! So disappointed!!","HORRIBLE experience. I booked a reservation, using a coupon code, noticed a mistake, and called customer service. They said it's best to cancel and start over. Now I can no longer use the coupon even though it's been applied to a cancelled reservation. Customer service said the system only recognizes it as being used and says there's nothing they can do. That is ridiculous.","Latest update has apparently made it impossible to connect via a VPN. Wise travellers use VPNs especially when they are on the road. Now the Orbitz UX is just as bad as that of Expedia, which I've pretty much abandoned for exactly this reason. Bad decision and hostile to the user.","This app is total garbage and Orbitz so is Orbitz customer service. I have been trying to book a flight all day and all I get is sorry try again later. Then try calling Orbitz is a total joke because you are on hold and after 51 minutes I just gave up. I suggest using anyone besides Orbitz because I believe they do this on purpose to get you to pay a higher fare, due in part you can't book at that time and so far the same flight has jumped $60.

I cant see why anyone would spend their money on this game. You can't even get more characters or go anywhere else other than the apartment overall I would rate it a 0/5 stars but u can't so this will do","kinda disappointed bc why is there only an apartment for free? u cant even use the other characters bc u have to pay for them and theres barely any clothes for them to wear. please improve this game a bit, u dont have to unlock other locations just at least add some clothes and characters for free thanks","Really cool stuff and detail!! Has alot of potential but the other reviews are not exaggeration EVERYTHING but ONE building you have to pay for. They should ,make more things free or have to watch an add, you only have the apartment to use the rest you have to pay for it is really disappointing.","Well its ok the apartment is ok. but thats the only thing that is free everything cost cute tho I am giving a 2 star if u make better i will give u a higher \"Review\" there's a person saying its awesome it needs to be free u can make some places cost but good game its cute like the name Have a blessed day Kind regards Emma grace 😃☺ Sorry uninstalling good game bye bye☺😃☺😃"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.miga.mytown","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.miga.mytown&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"My Boo: Your Virtual Pet Game To Care and Play","description":"Meet Boo, your very own virtual pet!

The mini games are awesome and it's lots of fun to take care of the little booth thing. You can unlock new things as you go and socialize with other boos. Definitely entertaining. One of my favorite mini games is the piano game and you can earn coins from doing that. If I were to compare this game to talking Tom, this game would definitely be better. So many features and cool stuff to do.","It's great! But I feel like they have items for characters that aren't in the sets section for example: there is a scouter, the hair, and the clothes from the dragon ball franchise and I feel like they could add much more, plus if someone wants to make an outfit but can't because they can't find all the items that would just suck also there is no real online so 6/10 could be better but good game","This game is awsome! i love this so much its laggy a little bit for me but thats ok. I love boo clime and piano boo there both great games i like the outside well you know how theres home,prophiles,games, and outside well i wish there was more to explore like outside mabye more to the house(NOT saying you have to add those) but other then that its a great game!","Addicting and good variety. Downloaded it again after a few years and I still like it! But sometimes it lags, sometimes my boo double jumps, a few times my boo was sleeping but not in the bedroom and sometimes when I refresh the game while boo to sleeping, the bar of energy is full without waiting. Hope you fix, good game! :)","I'm confused who this game is for, it would seem you want kids to watch Ads, they can't find the skip button, and they can install things far too easily. And no pay option to get rid of Ads. On the other hand the characters are so 'cutsie' and simple controls, so how would an adult get obsessed with this game. There has been no noticable update on this game for years. And many Face options do not fit with all of Boo's expressions."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"br.com.tapps.myboo","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=br.com.tapps.myboo&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Sweet Baby Girl Summer Fun 2 - Sunny Makeover Game","description":"Play the best summer holiday games for girls and boys!

Happy shopping! Oh, and don&#39;t forget to refer friends so you both win.","comments":["Overall I like this app. However there are a few things that would make this more user friendly. 1) When moving the map to a new location, the Search This Area could be auto-enabled. Tho, this is a minor thing 2) When zooming to a particular level, and clicking on Search This Area, \"don't\" rezoom. The map does not need to be moved, zoomed in/out, to include or exclude stations. Just leave the map where it is. I have had several times where I needed to re-zoom \"IN\" because the app zoomed out. I didn't need see the stations that are 10 miles from me, I wanted to see the ones within a few miles. If I wanted to include those other stations, I would of zoomed further out. 3) Have a list to display stations instead of \"just\" the map. This list would allow us to sort by Price of Fuel, Rebate Amount, Distance from Current Location, Price of Fuel w/ Discount. In an area with lots of stations, the map can become overloaded with Station Dots that it makes it difficult see the listing and rebate, and to click on the right one. 4) Have the option to report a station. Yesterday I went to a station that was listed as being 10¢ off, when I got there, all the pumps had been removed, and it had been days since they were done because the new concrete had fully cured. So I had drove 5 miles in the opposite direction I needed to go because I was under the impression this station had that best Price with & without the rebate. 5) When in More Info mode, the map at the top shows live data, just like the main map does. Also, clicking on this map keeps me inside the app, not launching a browser/map app for directions. Give us the option to open an external app. The GetUpside app already has a built in map with directions, use that one please I am rating as a 4 because despite those above issues, I think this app is pretty good so far. It could be better, but it does a pretty good job, albeit a little clumsily. I hope future updates will make the app easier to use with more information directly available.","Love and use the app so much more now that more of the stations I stop at have the check-in option. The app has always been great but I used to have trouble with the stations on my route always being out of receipt paper which caused me to miss out on some of discounts... But now with the check-in option I don't have to worry about that any more. Thanks Get Upside!!!!","This app not worth it at all. So you can only go to the highest gas stations listed on there maps. And it shows you a price of gas at 4.05 a gal and show a reduced price like 3.65 like that's what your about to pay at the pump. I filled up all 3 times just to give the app a chance. I got $1.74 back after spending $40 I have yet to see the other transactions which was for $20 and $25 of gas probably only get a few cents moral of the story is. ITS NOT WORTH IT DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR YOUR MONEY.","This app sucks. Tried to enter Wendy's receipt app wouldn't take it, I bought gas thepump didn't give receipt, went to Freddy's they don't put their name on receipt. I should have over $30 by now app has only given me $7.59 waste of time. Not to mention having to drive out of my way to go to a gas station that is on this app. No thanks. I'm OUT.","Been using this app for about year. I've found to be pretty useful, always try to use it when I get gas. Their new direct deposit feature though does not work at all. I've been trying to connect my bank account for 2 days now. Every I try it the credentials are correct and I get through all the verification then at the very end there's always an error and it won't connect. I've tried it on and off wifi and I've contacted support twice now with no answer.

Many people have been saying how none of the other rooms are available, and unfortunately, I've come to say the same thing. Maybe it will attract younger children, (1-3) but for older kids such as my sister, (5) they will easily realise that they have limited space to play in/with. I mean obviously, most people would get bored with such little options and will delete it quite promtly Disappointing:(","I hate the game! And the problem is there are just only 2 rooms are available the kids room and parents room and the garden,bathroom is located and we need to pay so many money just for a game 🎮 🙁😕 even my little brother play this but he ask he can't use the other 3 rooms,and this a kids game duh!?! I promise this game is boring for kids..","I like your games but I looked in nearly every room in every one of these games and there locked and I went through the ratings of these games and there is loads of complaints about the locks I know you earn money for this but I would not mind watching ads that way it's even you get money we actually get the full game and if you don't change this I'll stop playing your games and start playing toka world cuz they give ads not lock please fix this or even look through your ratings please!! 🙏🙏🙏","Could you atleast open the kids bedroom and washroom please i love this game but the only thing that is bad is that you have to pay to open room you just got like the kitchen living room and the outside area i like love all your games but because of this problem i am not giving you five stars the concept is really good but because of this problem i am not giving you five stars i hope you read this thank you.","I really love this game I really do and Its fun and all but I wanna have all rooms free like your others game aswell.plz read all the reviews I want to have alot more things than just 2/3 rooms.It makes the fun of it less fun 😔.So all were asking is to make the game free!!🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏❤ otherwise THIS GAME IS SOOOOO FUN!!!!!!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.playtoddlers.sweethomestories.free","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.playtoddlers.sweethomestories.free&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Dubsmash - Create & Watch Videos","description":"Dubsmash believes in the power of representation through video.

You can play dress up with your pets. And play mini games. But I have a question that came up in my head. When we collect all of the colored pets what happens next? I mean you can still play mini games and play dress up. But who wants to do that for the rest of the game? Please add more pets. And more mini games. I think that would help. Thank you!","Hatch, collect & care for cute animals in this fun virtual pet game for kids! Welcome to the sweet and dreamy world of Fluvsies — extremely fuzzy and ultra cute pets! Take care of these little pets and collect them all! Play Fluvsies — a super cute virtual pet care game for girls and boys! NEW! Pet Fashion Salon Now you can dress up your cute virtual pets in stylish outfits! Choose among tons of cute dresses and accessories and turn Fluvsies into real pet fashionistas. NEW! Pet Cafe Fluvsies","THIS GAME IS AMAZING! First, start out with a little egg that you can hatch and feed and play with! But then there's more, you can hatch more eggs and then breed babies, the babies will grow up then you'll have your own FLUVSIE! I love everything about it! Although there's one thing I think they could change there is a limited amount of characters and there's not that much. If the creators of Fluvsies hear this that is something you can improve on. Thank you for reading my review! God bless you!","The game is nice, but I don't like how when an ad comes up while tou're playing, so does the bar at the bottom of your phone, and it covers the X button on the ad so I have to restart the app just to get rid of it. Also, the increasing wait time for eggs to hatch is nice, but by the time you get to the very last pets, I think it just gets way too long. I've had to wait 24 hours for 3 eggs and 40 hours for 2, and it's just not fun anymore.","This game is best love it. All the flusives are so cute. I request you to add some stuff like more characters and more toys, beds and food and dresses. More minigames and events like a gift event and coins event will make this best. It is still best, but the lack of these things made me give 4 stars, actually 100 stars."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.tutotoons.app.fluvsies.free","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tutotoons.app.fluvsies.free&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"PJ Masks™: Moonlight Heroes","description":"Choose your favorite hero character to play with, and journey across the moonlit rooftops and through the night, collecting as many orbs as you can.

You get a lot of levels for free plus free daily and weekly challenges. I did pay to unlock all the levels (which i think was $4). There are ads but if you pay for any level or color theme, the ads are removed.","I love this game. I have always found it very fun, but right now there are way to many ads. Every time I turn around there is an ad popping up. Now, I don't mind the occasional ad here and there. No big deal, but literally every time I finish a puzzle there's an ad. I change the screen and there's another ad. Please reduce the ad amount.","Fun game, simple premise. One of the few games I'm naturally talented at and one I enjoy greatly. Only thing that makes it lose a star is the almost excessive amount of forced ads that disrupt the flow of the game overall. It is nice to have ads as an option for hints but forced ads take away from my enjoyment of the game.","Easy and fun, a great way to kill some time. If you're colorblind then worry not as it has a setting that puts letters on the dots! Not a fan of letters? Well then just hold/make a path with one dot and it's counterpart will pulsate! Does have ads but they don't appear immediately after you complete a level. Also if you don't like playing with sound, then the game has you covered as if you mute the sound the ads also stay muted. Overall pretty great game.","At first I was just trying to find a game to play because I was bored I ended up installing, flow free. It turned out a lot better than I expected. Is a very nice way to relax and pass time. But it is also pretty strategic, and sometimes the levels are challenging. I definitely recommend it. And the ads aren't as frequent to my surprise as well."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.bigduckgames.flow","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bigduckgames.flow&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Clover Dating App","description":"Whether you’re looking for love, a short-term relationship, or a friend, Clover is a perfect pocket pal with over 16 million dates scheduled through the app!

While I don't always remember to log my water intake, this app has helped me remember to drink liquids regularly. Thanks for keeping me hydrated! ^.^ Also the avitars are super cute. ;)","Purchased the full version, which was good until the last few updates. Now it is back to the unpaid version, I've lost my history, and it prompts me to buy the app. I can't adjust the hydro level for the drinks, it forgets fully half of the things I enter, and it's buggy af. I'm really annoyed, given how much it cost.","I love this app. It's cute, simple, and easy to use, and it does make me drink more water than I normally would. However, it's buggy af. I bought the pro version awhile ago and it was working fine, but with the last few updates they've done, the app doesn't recognize that I have the pro version and randomly gives me a pop-up asking me to purchase. There are a lot of other issues that didn't exist before that just make the app less enjoyable to use. Please fix these!","A really cute and super easy to use app, I haven't had any issues with it. My only problem with the app is that it's on subscription to get the full app, I'd happily pay a one off amount to buy the full version, but not an ongoing fee. You do still get a good amount of the app in the free version. It's a great app and the little characters are so cute.","1 star, disappointed because: - I'm still getting advertisements even though I bought premium - Some stuff is still in Russian language and I don't know what it says - Some translations in German language are poor. - Developer doesn't reply to emails. - Kills your phone battery - paid for an unusable app, too bad.

Using whatsapp from a long time. The new features are making it better with each new update. There is a filter feature which might be needed by some people for group messages. An option to display message receieved from a particular person and hide the others. I know we have a search feature, but a filter might help to focus on messages receieved from an important person in a group.","With the new voicenote speeds, I can no longer listen to my audios in a headset or silently using the ear speaker that u usually use to pick calls, because somehow it keeps playing my notification tone and I can't listen to what the other person is saying in the audio. look, focus on the important things, audio speed(X1, X1.5, X2) is not what a WhatsApp user is looking for. The voices are not even the same. Just don't be hilarious. Work on the important stuff.","Since the upgrade, it began draining my battery like crazy. Support tried telling me it was normal. I used Facebook often and it used 5% of my battery. I didn't use Whatsapp for a week and it was using more than 45% of my total battery, even though I restricted background use fully. That is NOT normal. If I could give it zero stars I would since now it is 100% useless, just like their 'support'.","Usually i would give a good review but the recent update is terrible. We are already aware and have full intention of connecting to WhatsApp web on PC that we go to that section in the app. But the app again asks us to tap a button 'link to a device' and then again asks us another confirmation by either a password, or finger touch, or face recognition!!!! What the hell is that??? All these confirmations to just access the web page of WhatsApp? We want easy user interface. Not more complications!","It sucks that you can't log in on the same account on different devices. It also doesn't save any conversations from the other device if you look at it from the other one :/ Which also sucks alot And last time I logged in it didn't even give me to restore my backup. I now hate this app but I still need to use it. and it only lets you resend verification messages after like 7 hours. After even 13 hours"],"editorsChoice":true,"appId":"com.whatsapp","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.whatsapp&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Miga Town: My Vacation","description":"Miga Town:My Vacation,Welcome to the new world of adventure – drive your own car, start a new journey and search the island for great treasures.

I am so tight I highly doubt I will be doing splits in aonth, but I really like the app. There is a little picture that shows you how to do the stretch during the rest in between each stretch, a count down timer to let you know how much longer on that stretch, and a voice instruction with a tip basically, to tell you how to do the stretch. Something like keep you back straight or point your toes to help you to do the stretch correctly.","I think its a wonderful app, i definitly see improvement in flexibility, no splits yet but its not a marathon. 30 days is an exaggeration for sure, intermediate level even starts you if you can reach 135 degrees which isnt a split. Its short and sweet, i do mine every morning as a really beautiful way to start my day. Love it","Only 2 days in, but I really like it so far. I feel sore but not in pain the next day, and my lazy behind is actually willing to complete the workouts (*between commercials while watching tv). The reminder function helps keep you going. I'm already looking at other titles from this company for a morning workout. Too much? Probably, but I'm doing it anyway!","This app is great! (Just finished day 1). Im in martial arts, but lost lots of flexibility in 2020, & am trying to get back to where i was physically. The app leads you with little animations that even show transition movements, which I've only really seen on ads for paid apps so far. Im so glad this is free, because i would not have downloaded it otherwise. When I used to try paid apps, I often dislike the user interface, so I feel like i wasted my money. Im looking forward to the next 29 days!","It's pretty good. It gives you step by step instructions on how to do the stretches and it's really simple to use. I would recommend this to people who are not a dancer or gymnast and who want to learn how to do the splits because It's amazing And you can open the app and do your stretches anytime. I love it really useful and positive ❤"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"splits.splitstraining.dothesplits.splitsin30days","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=splits.splitstraining.dothesplits.splitsin30days&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Solar Smash","description":"Solar Smash is a planet destruction simulator, it allows the player to use a variety of different weapons to destroy the planet.

It is easily one of the best sandboxes I've played in a LONG time. From the controls, to the graphics, to the multitude of weaponry, everything was done right. The attention to detail is astonishing for a game of it's type, as most of these space sandbox games are so crude it's not even funny, and not only has one planet but multiple, with varying environments at that. Overall I love this game(so much so I'm joining the beta when a spot opens)and hope you give it a try.","This game is top notch. It has amazing graphics and good physics. I would prefer there to be weather events that harm areas which placed on. Maybe more realistic meteor collisions? Like over time the climate becomes frozen from the change of climate? When the meteor hits, it would break into pieces and fly earth chunks into space. That would be mighty cool. That is all. This game is just amazing overall. Good job, developer(s)!","This game is probably the best mobile game, but i want to add more weapons. I would like a hurricane. It is only attached to the planet and tiny lighting lights glow on it. You can change the size to little to unreal sizes. Also add a \"flood\" count and show how many cities are flooded. I would also like another weapon that is also attached to the earth. \"The Plague\". To show how many are infected, you have an infected count to see how many are infected, like the hurricane I suggested.","A nice distraction game. My only question remains is why earth is the only planet in the solar system to have a moon. I'm pretty sure there is like over 100 moons in the solar system, especially Jupiter and Saturn. I'm guessing there's too much moons to add, but thats just me saying a dumb and unnecessary question. Still a nice game overall.","So I've watched videos about the new update! I've had the game for a while and it's a very good game. But there's one thing I've been playing it and there's been a lot of ads so if you can fix that. Thank you. But can you make like a five nights at Freddy's planet or some type of game planet? Or at least make the the logo for solar smash a planet. I really like that you can get secret planets. I personally think it's pretty cool I just want a couple other planets.

Thank you ovo, you never stops dissappointing, well done","The system needs exactly one hour to refresh when my account was blocked. Even after I reported there's nothing they can do. The stupid phone operators are practically useless. Why open a phone line only to tell people that the system needa an hour to refresh? Perhaps it's a good application but the customer service is totally rubbish!","Useless,this is the worst app. I have top up through the merchant on the written receipt it has been successful, but it has been 24 hours my balance has not increased, I have sent an email to OVO and I was told to confirm to the sender, even though the sender has succeeded, indeed the application is the only one problematic, even though the OVO balance has been re-sent, and it has been successful but my balance still hasn't changed, I don't recommend this application to all of you.","This is getting so bad,i've top up 300k rupiah,,just to normal purchases,buying pulsa etc..it keep reporting transactions cancelled cant get through....

It was too demanding for my phone. Yes, I admit, my phone isn't great. But it can run most games like this. Even ISEPS, a particle simulation, which should be quite hard to run, with it's hundreds of particles on the screen at once, is much easier to run than this. If I complete a level or open the menu in this game, it freezes. Yes, my phone is bad, but if the developers could please improve the running quality, that'd be great.","I originally gave this game five stars, but I came back to play it after awhile and they have added far too many ads. There's an ad after every level, and after every time you mess up. I'm ok with a few ads every now and then, but it's taken to a ridiculous level on this game. I wouldn't recommend the download.","The game is interesting at first and it keeps you entertained but the problem I am experiencing is that after I completed level 2, Level 3 started to glitch and I was disappointed with it. It was unplayable and I simply clicked out and removed the tab, I tried to open it back again and as soon as I clicked on level 3. It froze and nothing was playable, please fix this bug because I do enjoy this game.","It's an okay music rythm game, but when connected to the internet it will become too demanding for most \"lower end\" devices due to the ads adding strain to the system.

I can not get live feed from my backyard or garage pad and it doesn't record the garage pad at all. My vehicle has been broken into since the system has been installed and it has not recorded it happening. I have dealt with the installers multiple times and ADT and still the problems have not been resolved. I sent a message to the app and got no response. I don't recommend this app or the system that goes with it.","This app used to be good and reliable. However, for the past month it has been terrible. Sporadically sends push notifications and text messages, even though it is set-up to send then every time a video us recorded. Does not always identify objects in camera clip videos and just says camera triggered. All of this was working perfectly before. I have tried uninstalling a reinstalling and have even deleted my phone and added again. Nothing works!","Absolutely unorganized! I can’t create an account. I was with ADT which was bought by Telus. I dialled 10 different numbers from the internet to try to get in touch with them. When I finally got through, I was served by an incompetent person. She couldn’t help me create an account. She asked me 4 times when I was switched from ADT to Telus. I answered since Dec 9th. She asked 2021 ? Duh !!!! If you’re reading these comments ADT one Telus, would you please check your apps and sites so we can create an account ?","Can't control my thermostats. The tech was here yesterday and ever since he fixed my system, the app only shows what my thermostats were set at when he fixed them all up. It shows it was updated X amount of hours ago and that number keeps rising. It won't follow the schedule I set up and won't change the temp from my phone. I essentially have ZERO control over my thermostats and cannot check the temp or change it.","Not too happy with the products or service. Waste of my money. App does not work always, live video stop recording whenever. Also, you cannot go back and review because camera does not record well.

It displays a list of moveable apps that are not currently on SD and allows me to move them as a batch, something that other developers claim needs root access. It also notifies me whenever an apps joins this list. The ignore list is useful if you have an app that will only run if you move it using its own internal option. It provides cache cleaning for large caches, which is useful when a device is grinding to a halt. The developer is very helpful.","I downloaded this app hoping that I could move my large apps to an SD card and have more internal storage. I found out shortly after installing that I'm unable to move any apps to the SD card using the app. I always get an error message whenever I try to. Looking at other reviews, I can see I'm not the only one with this issue. It's not the apps fault though. It's simply that my device doesn't allow me to move any app to external storage, which is quite disappointing.","Great tool with 1 long standing bug. This tool provides a lot of functions that are hard to find elsewhere, especially in one app. However it has one bug that has had for years. When running Clean Cash at often locks up in the middle and you have to hit the back button multiple times and wait until a popup offers you the opportunity to close the app. You can't minimize it or back out of it, the whole device is locked up until this happens.","It does move apps to the SD card & clear caches in much fewer steps than doing it manually for each app. (Note, most will NOT stay on the SD card, but if you disable auto-update for an app in Play, it'll at least go back to phone storage less often.) However, my biggest complaint is that you cannot use your phone or do ANYTHING at all while it's running-- & for the SD card transfers, that takes a really long time. I don't understand why, given that you can use your phone during manual transfers.","Great app, Had it for over a month now. Does what it says. No problems. I recomend it. (Update) I recently bought a Samsung A7 Tablet. For some reason I am unable to move any apps to SD using this App. UPDATE!

Hiding the countdown negates MD's timer controls, & pressing the power button to see timers negates MD. & I wish the battery circle respected my Accent color, or that it was at least apropos green.","Using a Moto Edge, the tap to wake feature is either bugged or the implementation makes no sense.

I wasn't sure what it was for or where it came from, but after Google'ing found out it is pretty important for connecting some of my wireless devices such as fitness trackers and watches. It's a pretty slick app that operates in the background, with low overhead.","Rubbish app settings in battery and data usage keep turning on when I go to turn it off. Galaxy apps as well use a lot of them and drain a hell of a lot battery and RAM usage. It even disapproves permissions because why do apps need permission for certain things when the app wasn't designed for privacy permissions.

And similar other permissions exposing data and info.DUMB","Didn't had any idea this was on the phone until now. Still have no idea what it really does, why it's here or even if this is necessary. It only says, it was installed by the manufacturer. There's no point in disabling something that can't be removed. It will still consume space. Hopefully this doesn't consume too much space.","Not given logical reason for this unnecessary need on my device. If communication between devices via bluetooth is not needing said app then what is this purpose. I can use all devices when disabled or vague \"uninstalled\" options... sorry not sorry. If I can be proven or believed otherwise then I'll stand corrected. Till then GET OFF MY DEVICES IF ITS NOT NECESSARY FOR ITS FUNCTIONAL USE. Thanks, but no thanks!","The app probably deserves 5 stars but it has an annoying shortcoming as there is no way (at least as I can find) to select and delete multiple open/closed notifications.
