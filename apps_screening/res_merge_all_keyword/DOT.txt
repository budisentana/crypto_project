Bloody greedy game, out to exploit its players This game is all about money. In your face adds, each time you start playing. I've enjoyed playing the hidden object, but don't like having to pay for the final levels. You're telling players to buy things during the pandemic? People are struggling to afford NECESSARY items. SHAME ON YOU!!! It's not much better, but I still go back to it! I'm hooked unfortunately!?","Game may be fun but I won't be sure because it's another one with FALSE ADVERTISING. The game in the ad is NOT the game you download. This is now a common practice in game apps and it's infuriating. The app companies often use a third party to advertise and those companies only care that you download and not how long you play. This practice needs to stop.","I'm loving the basics of the game but all the extra stuff near ruins it. They make you walk through extra random things that have nothing to do with the dot game and they keep giving boost helps whether you want them or not. The streak boosts are getting ridiculous. \"Oh look, you're good at this. Lets make it easier!\" NO I want to play it. Not have the boost win each level for me without having to try. Let me at least decline them.","Fun challenge until level 90, then loot boxes needed to avoid super repetitive pain. Before this point, having the 5 win game streak is mostly enough. But after, the streak is roughly mandatory AND you'll need the other power ups... Levels may still be doable, but will greatly depend on the random dot layout whether it takes you 12 or 36 more tries. (Which may not be possible if you don't have \"infinite lives\" active at that time.)","Completely different than ad. I installed this game because I saw an ad for it. What I got was completely different and nothing like that advertised game. Why show a fake ad? Show an ad of what you actually get. This is stupid. All lies. Shame on you! Completely false advertising. If your game is so awesome then why aren't you showing pictures of it? Why you showing pictures of something completely different?

The app has been updated to include a new overdraft feature, updated direct deposit information and access to the INT-1099 form.","comments":["I really appreciate the app. It's performed mostly well. I did observe an issue where it keeps prompting me to get a security code each time I use it although I have selected the option to 'remember me/device'. Also, it never actually sends the code to my phone as selected the text is never received, resulting in me having to go back and select email option. Seems like it gets stuck.","I got a refund for a security deposit and they closed my account. No notification to me. Just a failed direct deposit. After calling them several times with the call dropping I decided it's just not worth the hassle.","Edit: my green dot app hasnt worked since yesterday. It opens and tells my balance and everything else but i have all my money \"stashed\" because i have spent whats available. As i try to unstash my money it will not let it keeps saying \" temporarily unavailable\" so this has been goin on since last night which turned my life into a nightmare. I had to call into work today because i cant get gas. I cant get food or diapers for my daughter. Its to early in michigan to call family and ask to borrow","Absolutely Terrible! Please don't waist your time or money on Green Dot! I spent 1 hour trying to use this worthless card using the app. Finally, it said to call customer service. I called and was hung up on the first time. Second call was put on perpetual hold. Never again.","Its a lot more simple than using big name banks its easy to send money and recieve money.. You never really deal with fraud or random fees or freezes on your account only issue i have, because its a prepaid card, it isnt accepted by certain websites or certain apps for the most part that almost never happens anyway plus cutomer service helps within the first and second rep.. Not bounced to mutiple people trying ro unfreeze ur account and bs also u can load your card and buy snacks at once"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.cardinalcommerce.greendot","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cardinalcommerce.greendot&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Dot n Beat - Test your hand speed","description":"We're proud to present you with an ever-Challenging & Sparkling music game with both Exquisite graphics and Vibrant rhythms!\r\nYour Best Time Killer!

The access log is great Could use more customization options, particularly individual locations for each dot. Problems: The dots do not demo themselves while setting location The \"around camera\" setting requires the energy ring app to be active. But if i don't want the energy ring (i prefer energy bar), i can't use \"around camera\"","The concept is very helpful just like iOS devices but the only problem is that the indicator is too faint to be noticed at a corner of a screen. Make it more saturated or give the user a slider to set the saturation level of the dots. With a white theme applied, it is very difficult to be noticed right away. Post this fix I'll give you a 5 star😉😉","Grade A app. Absolutely love the features. I understand this is still in beta, but unfortunately, the location dot doesn't work for me. Specifically, it'll work for a while after the service is first activated, but then it won't show up even when using Maps. I would have to revoke and allow the location permission every few days. Hope it gets worked out soon. The camera and microphone dots work flawlessly, though. Great work 👍","Simple app, that brings visibility into mic/camera/location usage that should be baked into android by default, however the icon appears in the middle of the screen in landscape mode. There doesn't seem to be any settings to adjust position when not holding the phone in portrait orientation. Currently I'm on the paid AD_3.6_BETA (hasn't been updated in quite a while) on an S21.","I like the idea, and when the app is working it's great...

Many of the puzzles that I already earned with coins now require me to pay membership for. I used to play this game about 2-3 hours a day. Not now. I'm on a very low fixed income and can't afford this. It's also a lot slower. I can't connect the dots as fast as before. Very, very disappointing!!!","I'm enjoying the new update especially the XL ones and the new look. But I do have some comments: - many things have been reformatted not updated - I wish you would provide explanations on the new modes - the colors can be difficult to use but I'm thankful to be able to change the background - on some puzzles I got to a point and suddenly the next number in the sequence disappears; on smaller puzzles this doesn't happen. This is very frustrating Thank you for your efforts!","This app is A LOT of fun and it has Challenging puzzles and different levels for every puzzle. I do wish that they had space / NASA puzzles and more puzzles in the tens of thousands. This game is easy to let yourself relax and enjoy the dot to dot puzzles. Thank you for this app!! Please add more dot to dots soon.","Everyone I get so far through a puzzle I keep loosing the number that is next I disappears the only way I find it is tapping randomly in the area I think it is in It is hard to do a screen shot of how it happens it will only show it is missing 1993 Looks like a crocodile on free section but it's happens on a couple now No ive played these alot when i press on one number the next one disappears ive had thus on another device and played lots the set was different though It wasnt just that one","Good would be 5 stars had it not changed now to premium purchase rather then saving to get larger puzzles more numbers"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.ocigrup.dotforadults","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ocigrup.dotforadults&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Dot to Dot to Coloring","description":"Dot to Dot to Coloring is the most innovative dot connect coloring game.

What I like to do is listen to my audio book and lying in my bed while playing this game.","I love this game i play it every day. It is so intertaning. Wen i am bord i always play Dot to Dot. Wen my tablet is out of garge i am very sad becouse i cant play Dot to Dot. I alredy have 20 done. I apsilotle lovae this game. I hate that wen after finishing a puzzel ther is an add. Wen an add comes it takes forever and the x to take the add away is not working. My dad tryed to see if it was just my tablet but my dad told me that it is the game that is not letting me press it.","I used to love this game, and would happily spend hours on it. Then there was an \"update\" and the game changed COMPLETELY. Not only did I lose all my progress, but all my hints as well - I had over 100. The puzzles are now far inferior to what they were, clunky to use, and rainbow with no option to change to white on a black background. And the ads! I don't mind the occasional ad or two, but 3 × 30 sec ads you can't skip when you finish a puzzle is extreme. Disappointed. Uninstalling.","I used to love using this app. I'm an avid dot-to-dot fan and these puzzles were easy to solve and fun to do. However, since this latest update, there have been far too many adverts. I understand that's how you make your money (I mean, who's gonna pay a subscription of £60odd per year for dot-to-dots?!), but showing three ads per click is too much. It's making me considering uninstalling this otherwise lovely app.","Did a couple, found it quite relaxing. However had to reinstall as the tablet crashed to the point where I had to mess around to find the bios and do a factory reset. This got the thing moving again, but it said I had to format the SD card (for some reason, this tablet insists that the SD can only work if it's essentially \"absorbed\" by the internal memory. Go figure). Needless to say I lost all data for this and had to reinstall. My antivirus software kicked in with a malware red alarm. To be safe it's uninstalled."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.number.draw.dot.to.dot.coloring","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.number.draw.dot.to.dot.coloring&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Brain Dots","description":"Over 40 million downloads!\r\n\r\nThe only thing you need to do is to “bump two balls.”\r\nWill you be able to clear these simple-looking but actually difficult stages?\r\n\r\n▼ The rules are simple!\r\n\r\n◆ Let's bump the two balls\r\nAll you need to do to clear a stage is to \r\n“make the blue and red balls bump”.\r\nDraw lines and shapes freely to move and roll the balls.\r\nFlexible thinking is going to become the key to victory.\r\n\r\n◆ Let's collect pens\r\nStarting off with a simple pencil, moving onto color pencils, crayons and so on.\r\nWe have prepared more than 25 varieties of pens of different colors and sizes.\r\nCollect various pens and walk through the stages.\r\n\r\n◆ Share the moment of victory \r\nYou can review the moment you cleared a stage on video or picture.\r\nShare it on SNS to show off your superior skills to your friends.\r\nNot to mention that watching your friends’ gameplay might also become a hint!?\r\n\r\n◆ Your brain abilities will be tested\r\nThis game, continuing after Brain Wars, also tests your logical thinking and the flexibility of your mind.\r\nAs this game includes the elements of riddle and “Escape the Room” type of games, we would recommend Brain Dots to people who enjoy brain-type puzzles, cards and strategy games.\r\nIt might also have an impact on your children’s intellectual growth and preventing brain deterioration?\r\n\r\n◆ Create Stages\r\nCreate your own stages and see if users\r\nall over the world can solve them.\r\nOver 3 million stages already created!\r\n\r\n▼ Languages \r\n15 languages!

Main problem is that keeps stopping.","So it is extremely irritating at times when you cant find the number but has some pictures. Needs more pictures and also SOMETIMES not all the time, when you exit out of the ad it will take you back home. All you have to do is wait a few minutes then try again. I would recommend this getting fixed but other than that it is a really good game and keeps you busy all day long 😁. Love it","I enjoy this app , very relaxing. 1. App needs more drawings. 2. Need to be able to move the whole drawing with the stylus (instead of using your finger) while connecting the dots. 3. just for grins, it would be nice to color the drawing after connecting the dots. Like paint by number. Other than that I will continue to connect the dots.","Automatically closes after exiting out of an ad, spotty usage, and just crappily simple pics. Would NOT recommend to ANYONE.","I really enjoy or should I say enjoyed this game, now when an add pops up I press close and the app crashes, please fix or i'm uninstalling the app."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"connect.the.dots.game","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=connect.the.dots.game&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Dots and Boxes - Squares ✔️","description":"The classic Dots and Boxes game to remember childhood.

I'm a big fan of dot the dots but there's a defect. Sometimes when im playing, if the dots are too close the lines won't connect right. Also the different colors make hit hard to see, especially the yellow. Other than that I love the game.","Update #2: figured out there is built-in \"hint\"... when a dot is successfully connected to the next dot, the number is grayed out, so i just have to look for numbers not grayed out to find what I may have missed. Also, I am now enjoying the multilines...again, the really jumbo puzzles area my favorite. Update: almost 3 weeks now and this is my go-to game for fun and for stress relief. I especially love the single-line puzzles with at least 500 or more dots. They are addictive! ENHANCEMENT REQUEST: it would be great to have a \"hint\" on where something is not right. Sometimes I miss one or two connections and it's hard to find among 600 or 700 dots! :) This is fun! Relatively brainless, which is what I need at times in order to relax. I especially love the complex pics with100s of dots. Nice, simple, soothing fun!","The puzzles can be solved with the instructions given. The connection from the active dot to the next dot can be formed simply by touching the next dot in sequence, either forward or backward. The connection to the next dot in the sequence can also be made by drawing the connecting line between the dots. This game does not require deductive reasoning to solve the puzzle, and the solution is less visually interesting than other Conceptis puzzle apps that form pictures.","I pay to buy other photos. It come out unable to download volume. Furthermore the photo that I pay earlier is missing from thw download.","The images are very vague for the most part. I was also hoping for a game where i have to actually draw the line rather than just mindlessly click one number after another.

It's calm and deceptively simple, with cute characters and artistic environments, PLUS NO ADS. Every other app I downloaded, I dropped it for the frequent ads just zapping my time. When I play a game, I want to play it, not sit through a dozen ads to do so. I haven't found a game worthy of my time and phone space like this one.","Two Dots and Dots & Co are two of my favorite games. The gameplay and aesthetic are charming, as well as the music which is far better than a mobile game ever needed to have. I had a couple frustrations with the game which I brought to the developers and they responded kindly within 24 hrs and fixed the problem. Great game, great service.","Nice little game but it be way better if the loot crates actually helped you or if you were able to earn items based on stars.

I was playing Two Dots, but it became nothing but an endless money sucking realm of frustration, or would have if I cared that much.

I use it not only to build habits, but also to track how many times per week i have a headache, clean things, water my plants, etc (i know this messes some of the statistics, but that's ok). It's like a visual diary, and I can even add notes! My only request is to add a weekday selector, so it can automatically skip a specific habit on weekends, for exemple. The add free version is a good price too, totally worth it.","Thank you for fixing backup.

It feels as if that level is impossible to beat but then again it is extremely challenging. the game is simple to play but challenging and needs alot of concentration and patience. overall the game is amazing","Bad as game gets you be good at timing even in other ways like catching anything if you drop it you catch it before it falls on the ground. HELPS YOU TO HAVE FAST REFLEXES","The \"ah oh\" is definitely annoying and the gamr is dull, needs better graphics, but its not that bad but i am deleting it because i thought it would be more fun"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.apponly.adddot","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apponly.adddot&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Dotz.io Dots Battle Arena","description":"In dotz io game, your goal is to become the biggest dot among others!

You get a lot of levels for free plus free daily and weekly challenges. I did pay to unlock all the levels (which i think was $4). There are ads but if you pay for any level or color theme, the ads are removed.","I love this game. I have always found it very fun, but right now there are way to many ads. Every time I turn around there is an ad popping up. Now, I don't mind the occasional ad here and there. No big deal, but literally every time I finish a puzzle there's an ad. I change the screen and there's another ad. Please reduce the ad amount.","Fun game, simple premise. One of the few games I'm naturally talented at and one I enjoy greatly. Only thing that makes it lose a star is the almost excessive amount of forced ads that disrupt the flow of the game overall. It is nice to have ads as an option for hints but forced ads take away from my enjoyment of the game.","Easy and fun, a great way to kill some time. If you're colorblind then worry not as it has a setting that puts letters on the dots! Not a fan of letters? Well then just hold/make a path with one dot and it's counterpart will pulsate! Does have ads but they don't appear immediately after you complete a level. Also if you don't like playing with sound, then the game has you covered as if you mute the sound the ads also stay muted. Overall pretty great game.","At first I was just trying to find a game to play because I was bored I ended up installing, flow free. It turned out a lot better than I expected. Is a very nice way to relax and pass time. But it is also pretty strategic, and sometimes the levels are challenging. I definitely recommend it. And the ads aren't as frequent to my surprise as well."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.bigduckgames.flow","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bigduckgames.flow&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Spot The Dot","description":"This is a little game where you have to react quickly to break objects.

Within minutes I was impressed. It's deceptively simple on the surface, but offers decent challenge, even for those who have played other dot-line-esque games. And I truly and deeply appreciate the philosophy stated regarding upgrading to premium if you choose to do so. Clearly the work of a game maker who enjoys games, not just one of the millions bent on raking in ad revenue with tired content. Instant fav.","I was to give 5 stars but in some way, I feel like as u progress in any game, u expect few changes to make it interesting, but NOOO!!!! theres no Difficulty wise, Graphics(Color, theme) wise, Patterns wise changes🙏🙏🙏 At start, at few lvls u will get stuck and Once u gets it , how it works!! then u wont find any muvhmore difference in upcoming lvls...!!! Just make sure game has Gradual changes and it will be superfine!!!!!👌👌👌","I have completed and replayed this game several times over the past few years, it is a satisfying and fun yet simple to understand and play puzzle game. I find it very relaxing with the music and the option of dark mode and the customizations you can make to your dot.","Lots of fun trying to find the way out. Having to go back and find a new route makes it challenging and keeps you trying until you solve the puzzle. Keep up the good work. Very addictive because it keeps you trying until you figure it out. I also have the problem of the dots being outside the perimeter of my screen. I use a galaxy note 9 and nothing I have changed in my settings will fix this problem. Has anyone figured this out yet?","I really like the game, very addicting. After completing the free levels, I bought the premium version. Here a few things I think could be better - Sometimes (mostly in infinity mode) the dots are cut off the screen (Xiaomi redmi 6a) - The blurry text is blurry - The sound of the dots connecting is very hard to listen to for a long time, maybe replace it with a satisfying more soft sound? - The black squares kinda don't fit in with the circle-y style of the game (or maybe add them in dot studio)"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.zerologicgames.findaway","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zerologicgames.findaway&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Dot Sniper","description":"This game is the Android game for the Web Game Site \"DAN-BALL\".

Fun! Then it gets harder, and I'm stumped. Back up a level and practice! Frustrating and captivating. Great game - when I can figure it out!","I really like this, but there are a few things that would improve this game. There are no hints, there is a \"give up\" option, when the solution to the puzzle appears, but you can't see the solution, because the box that contains options of playing a new game, or reviewing obscures the view. Also when you win a game, you are punished by having to view an loud, glaring ad for an obnoxious game. Other than that, I could play this for hours. It is intelligent and has many levels of difficulty.","Surprise, surprise surprise! Really enjoying this game!❣ I had NO intention of dwnlding this, but decided to just try it. THEN couldn't stop! And it is very fun to play! I loooove🥰 puzzles & this makes U look at this in different ways 🤔to figure out how to get from beginning to end w/o leaving out any dots!🙄 I LOVE IT!","Good but I dintend like the tramfromason that made all of your apps vertical than horizontal please bring all of your apps back to horizontal mode and respond to this comment","This is what I would have if I were stranded on an island for days.

It reminds me of my child years... but You missed twi stars for two reasons: 1- after 3 matches, it stuck twice.. that is too many.... Once i press messages and say hi, it doesn't close massages box.. so i can't see the play board and had to exit. 2- I can't change my name if i am playig as a guest... Too many names called (guest...) there!!! .","Really really easy. It's like the other player just allows me to win, except the first game where the other player seemed to cheat. I wish the game saved win/lose stats and I wish the there was some change in difficulty, either incremental as the player's \"level\" increased, or just by choosing easy, medium or hard. I also wish it had an undo button. Otherwise it's a good time killer. And it's free which is a definite plus.","Great game to play with actual friends or if you want to play against the computer. But if you want to play online with strangers, I'm quite convinced that I've played with bots every single time. Even when I play on the highest tier, the opponent never plays smart. The opponent's name is always GuestXXXX (X is a number) and I'm always the one who starts the game","While playing multiplayer mode, the opponent don't draw a line between two dots in the given time. After that what can i do. There is no punishment for don't take turn in the given time. Then i only have option to leave the match because i don't want to lost my time in it. From this we lose and opponent wins the match. This make no sense. Please make some punishment for don't take turn in the given time","While playing with friend, after creating room we have to always share that joining code for each time we play, please make a feature that once friend is join, we can add him/her as a friend. So, if you want to play again with same person we don't need to share code again and again we can add directly as implemented in Ludo King"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"in.codehound.dotlands","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.codehound.dotlands&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Dot to Dots: Connecting The Dots Game","description":"Introducing the best Dot to Dots drawing game in the market, Connect dots by number to reveal amazing drawings!

It teaches children to recognize and pronounce numbers and letters of the alphabet in a kid-friendly way.\r\n\r\nYour child will love playing Kids Connect the Dots, and you'll be able to relax, knowing your child is learning while having great fun.\r\n\r\nChildren tap on a series of dots that outline an animal or an object that the child usually can't quite identify.  As they tap on the dots or connect the dots, the numbers and ABC alphabet letters are pronounced.  When children succeed in connecting them all, the connected dots are delightfully transformed into a colorful graphic of whatever the child has outlined. It might be a bird or muffin, a giraffe or a treasure chest.\r\n\r\nPreschoolers are surprised and filled with wonder to see the creatures and objects they've created \"come to life\" – and want to go on to create more and more of them.\r\n\r\nThere are over 100 images in the full version for your child to enjoy.\r\n\r\n\r\n★★★★★ What will my children learn? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nYour child will learn to recognize and pronounce the numbers or letters in the dots.

Coping with stress and over-stimulation is therefore one skill that your kids won't be practicing during this game.  Its clear focus makes the game a delight for children and a winning choice for parents.\r\n\r\n\r\n✔ Kids love our games.   Parents love to see their preschool-aged children being both educated and quietly happy.\r\n\r\n✔ Our games are laser focused. For example, the numbers game doesn't teach letters, and the letters game doesn't teach math. We keep the games simple but magically inviting and nourishing.\r\n\r\n✔ We strive to give children just the right balance between education and fun. So our games don't feature fun at the expense of education – or education at the expense of fun. We also know games that are too complicated don’t involve and delight kids.","descriptionHTML":"Educational games for kids is all we do.<br><br>Kids Connect the Dots Lite contains 25 images to try it out before you buy the full version.<br><br>Preschoolers really connect with our Kids Connect the Dots game.

Coping with stress and over-stimulation is therefore one skill that your kids won&#39;t be practicing during this game.  Its clear focus makes the game a delight for children and a winning choice for parents.<br><br><br>✔ Kids love our games.   Parents love to see their preschool-aged children being both educated and quietly happy.<br><br>✔ Our games are laser focused. For example, the numbers game doesn&#39;t teach letters, and the letters game doesn&#39;t teach math. We keep the games simple but magically inviting and nourishing.<br><br>✔ We strive to give children just the right balance between education and fun. So our games don&#39;t feature fun at the expense of education – or education at the expense of fun. We also know games that are too complicated don’t involve and delight kids.","summary":"Connect all the dots and reveal the beautiful picture with this fun kids game.","installs":"5,000,000+","minInstalls":5000000,"maxInstalls":5479744,"score":3.7598412,"scoreText":"3.8","ratings":29697,"reviews":4741,"histogram":{"1":4577,"2":2298,"3":3094,"4":5432,"5":14293},"price":0,"free":true,"currency":"USD","priceText":"Free","offersIAP":false,"size":"Varies with device","androidVersion":"4.4","androidVersionText":"4.4 and up","developer":"Intellijoy Educational Games for Kids","developerId":"6695914693084197974","developerEmail":"questions@intellijoy.com","developerWebsite":"http://www.intellijoy.com","developerAddress":"Intellijoy\n8170 N.

I'm not sure i will get anything!","It's quite amusing, however haven't tried to cash out yet, so will re review once I try and cash out, no doubt it won't let me cash out, the usual bull of today's quota been paid out, but that's pessimistic of me,","I love this game, can't put it down. Upset about finishing 500 levels and not being allowed to get the $ 110 bonus for finishing them. It would give me enough to cash out. I finished the normal levels and the first two under 'Specialty\" but the rest won't unlock and I still haven't received the bonus at level 500 and still can't cash out.","Scam likely. The video feature that plays ad frequently says \"no video to show, try again later\", so it's impossible to reach the required amount for withdrawal (which I saw advertised that there was no minimum, but there is one which is not stated in the customer service articles). Fun game but not so great if you ever hope to cash out..","I really love playing this game because i like the challenge of using my brain to solve the problems. Some you really have to think about and have to restart to get it right. The only thing i can complain about now is that the chest won't open when their supposed too! I wish you would fix it!

I love this game. It's one of my favorites! I truly like it much, much more than \"2 dot's and Dots & Company! It's relaxing, fun, exciting and challenging at the same time. I would choose this game over those 2 games anytime. You would enjoy Blobs very much. I look forward to playing this game every day. I'm glad I found it. The creators of this game did a great job. Can't give this enough stars. 2 thumbs-up!","Very fun game! Would be great if instead of obtaining two flashing stars after collecting so many dots, the second would be a bonus 🌟. It's a fun game to play because you have to preplan and think. Don't need alot of \" bling\" to have an entertaining time. Thank you! Especially during theses days if covid-19!! Stay safe!","I am giving this game a bad review although it is well made and quite addictive as I find it a scam. As many \"free\" games on android by the way, you can move forward pretty easy at the begging but when you get to more advanced stages it becomes really dificult to continue without paying. It is really frustrating.","Love it this sucks I love my game I really do but it keeps freezing it's not just freezing now it's counting down in minutes how I can play again and then it won't let me could you fix it please. So I just ended up deleting the whole thing. I was on number 167. And now I'm stuck on 42 and can't get off of it it really sucks it took me a long time to get to that level so for me I like the game but the app part really sucks"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.apptornado.dotmatch","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apptornado.dotmatch&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Christmas Dot to Dot and Coloring Pages","description":"Christmas Dot to Dot Coloring game by TeachersParadise.com Studios let you create your very own coloring page!\r\n\r\nAn educational and entertaining game that lets players enjoy fun coloring activities.\r\n\r\nOver 40 free Christmas, Santa and winter time theme connect the dots coloring pages.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\nOver 40 Christmas connect the dots coloring activity pages\r\nOver 150 Colors\r\nPinch and Zoom\r\nMultiple coloring tools (crayons, pencils, markers)\r\nTitle: Christmas Coloring Dots Games\r\nCopyright 2015 TeachersParadise.com, Inc.\r\n\r\ncom.teachersparadise.christmascoloringdotsgames","descriptionHTML":"Christmas Dot to Dot Coloring game by TeachersParadise.com Studios let you create your very own coloring page!<br><br>An educational and entertaining game that lets players enjoy fun coloring activities.<br><br>Over 40 free Christmas, Santa and winter time theme connect the dots coloring pages.<br><br>Features:<br>Over 40 Christmas connect the dots coloring activity pages<br>Over 150 Colors<br>Pinch and Zoom<br>Multiple coloring tools (crayons, pencils, markers)<br>Title: Christmas Coloring Dots Games<br>Copyright 2015 TeachersParadise.com, Inc.<br><br>com.teachersparadise.christmascoloringdotsgames","summary":"Santa Claus is coming so have fun with Connect the dots and color the picture!","installs":"100,000+","minInstalls":100000,"maxInstalls":122146,"score":3.6941175,"scoreText":"3.7","ratings":85,"reviews":28,"histogram":{"1":20,"2":4,"3":6,"4":7,"5":48},"price":0,"free":true,"currency":"USD","priceText":"Free","offersIAP":false,"size":"5.0M","androidVersion":"2.3","androidVersionText":"2.3 and up","developer":"TeachersParadise.com","developerId":"5403193472609565119","developerEmail":"apps@teachersparadise.com","developerWebsite":"http://www.teachersparadise.com/","developerAddress":"TeachersParadise.com, Inc.\n13876 SW 56 St #226\nMiami, FL 33175","privacyPolicy":"http://www.teachersparadise.com/help/privacy-policy","developerInternalID":"5403193472609565119","genre":"Educational","genreId":"GAME_EDUCATIONAL","icon":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/miUTnTISoor_WdEdHDzAosRge4chl_O5pK1O5RFgSAqicNkolJZ0edcB4jN7r8jbfBQ","headerImage":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/BL-0EUOqRZm4Liz9aKv2Ks5e9ImYio9peRht79lNC48wWTif1EJyFLCokcfnofK5bxs","screenshots":["https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Q4p25mrXFTWwTA_fAvBUIwFE3oMjc4A9CDZpvUdTihuXmfeMBbK0gUfOi8LA_3vOzoU","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/7Rynt4AokMJl0vA2hNF3YvYubudeitqNr9MuzKyxYazUeEz3tucKOD97LLhp5PEMJSo","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/8L8ksn5-1MOJ5oXNO4mMSJdxOZ8AAfLga0clMMj1QUE8keVg4NrQYhghvh95V40B1i0O","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/LYGQHQKmuVcdq1v9BDbVcL9GbdyluHfPDF2bEehvQZAa7HhTDJfFVz1fzgbeiNzWr-M","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/E-i9P86nATYp42ujR_-3RHne4uI_0lpRtNqHWoVtrcM8l69J6wXLbflinNHFu775eHHn","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/E3SdAT6GUemoz_cs4aSlxHn4cbTyWuH6m9Krvq-9D39RBM1mc2pO5yx9h3dzpZ_na4E"],"contentRating":"Everyone","adSupported":true,"released":"Nov 26, 2015","updated":1448561491000,"version":"1","comments":["It is a good game","This is so lame","Best games for little kids like five what's a game sucks straight up and it don't even let you connect the dots there's too many ads there was 20 ads and 20 minutes so if you don't like it then don't play this game and it doesn't tell you how to draw","My four year old likes this app.","Luved it"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.teachersparadise.christmascoloringdotsgames","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teachersparadise.christmascoloringdotsgames&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Splashy Dots","description":"Imagine yourself in a cozy art gallery, with the sounds of a live jazz act in the background, brush in your hand and a canvas in front of you.

It reminds me of my child years... but You missed twi stars for two reasons: 1- after 3 matches, it stuck twice.. that is too many.... Once i press messages and say hi, it doesn't close massages box.. so i can't see the play board and had to exit. 2- I can't change my name if i am playig as a guest... Too many names called (guest...) there!!! .","Really really easy. It's like the other player just allows me to win, except the first game where the other player seemed to cheat. I wish the game saved win/lose stats and I wish the there was some change in difficulty, either incremental as the player's \"level\" increased, or just by choosing easy, medium or hard. I also wish it had an undo button. Otherwise it's a good time killer. And it's free which is a definite plus.","Great game to play with actual friends or if you want to play against the computer. But if you want to play online with strangers, I'm quite convinced that I've played with bots every single time. Even when I play on the highest tier, the opponent never plays smart. The opponent's name is always GuestXXXX (X is a number) and I'm always the one who starts the game","While playing multiplayer mode, the opponent don't draw a line between two dots in the given time. After that what can i do. There is no punishment for don't take turn in the given time. Then i only have option to leave the match because i don't want to lost my time in it. From this we lose and opponent wins the match. This make no sense. Please make some punishment for don't take turn in the given time","While playing with friend, after creating room we have to always share that joining code for each time we play, please make a feature that once friend is join, we can add him/her as a friend.

Well, now I get to the highest points that would be deemed possible & it resets and starts me off at 2's and 4's when my screen was full of 64 and 131 grands. This game is not worth your time, in otherwords. You conquer your previous high score and it will freeze everytime!","I noticed that I stopped earning coins when the dot sums up to 64 and up. Also, there was a time when the game resets when I stop playing it to charge my Android. So it gets frustrating whenever I play 2248 because I don't get the coins that I earned, and when the game resets to level 1 when I am already in level 21. Please fix these bugs because I enjoy playing this game.","I really like this game, I think I'm like 11th on the leaderboards now but that's in part because I discovered a flaw in the scoring system. Let's say you have 3 dots, (2, 2, 4). If I connect all 3 in one go, I score 8 points. But, if I connect the 2s first, scoring 4 points, and then the two 4s, scoring 8 points, I get 12 points. I think scores should be affected by a multiplier that rewards you for connecting more dots in one go, I think that would make the game much more interesting.","I like this app. It contains ads which sometimes distract from play time. Since the app is free to use, I figure the short ads are a small price to pay.","I have traumatic brain injury also Dementia and Parkinson's Disease.
