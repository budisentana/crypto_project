Major problem is the lag which often ends in crashes. Everytime it does that, all the scores and GWEI went with it, leaving you back on level 1. Crashes are very common when you're doing great with your game. It's like it does not favor that you win and make great points. As to the ETH you can earn, it's too minute and almost neglible to even think playing this game for years can change your life in the long run.","Amazing game ! I find myself sitting down for a quick 5-10 game and an hour later I'm still playing. It really does pay out, instantly ! EDIT : 07-25-21 The game used to be 5 stars, now it's a weak 3 star game. Adds have increased 100%. I just scored 32000+ and for that effort, I was given 675 gwei ?!! A score like that should have paid out 4x that amount. Come on team, don't get cheap on us, the price of Ethereum is down. The payout SHOULD GO UP !!!!!!","Does what it says it does. Great mindless game for meetings or when watching TV. If you're going to mess around on Candy Crush, why not get paid for it? I've made some decent cash off of this and it's funding my smaller crypto investments. Yeah, there's ads. You get used to them, especially once you know how long they last. Just put the tv on and look up when an ad comes on. Great app, wish there were more like it.","Pays out easily and quickly with coinbase. 5 stars. The game is fun. BUT!!! constantly glitches and you have to start over. I was just on a roll, my best game. Start of level 6, a flash, and im back at level 1, and my coins are gone! You still get credit for ETH. But its totally deflating, and makes people stop playing. IF THE GAME STOPPED CRASHING ID GIVE 5 STARS AND PLAY MORE. VERY DISAPPOINTED","Sure enough, it pays out Ethereum almost instantly. It's kind of hard to get figured out, though. You need to go into where it says redeem in order to get it sent to your wallet. Doesn't add up fast at all, but it's an all right time waster. And tons of ads, but that should be a given for anyone looking at this kind of thing.

And they're other app, Make-Money, is worse. They use to be honest and payout. Now they spit lies in your face and never deliver payment for completed tasks. Saying it's their partners, but I spoke with their partners and the all paid these people to pay me. Scam. Shameful. Waste of time. Liars. Cheats. That's this company. Very angry. Almost $300.00 owed they won't pay","I havent got my first payout yet but, I must say, this app is amaizing. Easy to earn coins and a fast payout of 50000 coins. I just tried an app and got 45000 coins. Easy to use, familiar theme and fun to watch videos. It feels like the videos will never end and for 28 sec video you get 28 coins which means for a 5 hour video, 50000 coins and direct cashout. Thank you so much for the app. Keep the work up!","Frustrating. I have tried to select more rewards and ended up wasting coins on rewards that were not adequately explained. There's no point in spending 200+ dollars to win 100 Dollars. Additionally I downloaded this because I saw it on another game it was advertised as an earnoney to do tasks app when that's not quite what it is AT ALL","Not a pleasant experience. Whenever you complete a task it goes to the progress and even after many days the points are not transferred to wallet . On lodging a complain it says we will reply you in 5 working days but even after few weeks didn't got a rply.","This application really is amazing. It was actually a Hidden Gem from me for quite some time. Because I kept seeing it and noticing that it had such high reviews and such a high rating but for some reason it took me over a year before I tried it out for myself and I'm very impressed with it.

The app auto rotates horizontally but in the wrong way for me. My charge port is on the bottom of my table and my cable is on the left. This auto rotate only flips right and won't flip to the left. So i now have a long cable across my lap because of it and this puts undue stress on the charge. Then when trying to watch a vid in app it flips the other way. Wth! Very annoying! Maybe it is not optimized for a tablet but in this day and age it should be!","Used daily for three months. Love the ability to open a few wallets of the same crypto in order to segregate my transactions. Also can include personal notes for both incoming and outgoing transactions to keep tabs of sending and receiving. Both of these features may not be available in other wallets. Hope to see more crypto supported, so that I can streamline my wallets.","After their new update, converting your crypto to usdt is much more reliable and faster unlike before. I also like that they add bitcoin and ethereum wallet so we can further diversify our portfolio. The clean ui also make the app more friendly to users. However, these past few days, the app ocassionally shows a red notice at the top saying to retry reconnecting to server ( I cant remember the exact words but it looks like that). Overall, the update is excellent. Just a little tweak will do.","One thing I really love with this is that I can create multiple wallets so I can sort out my budgets and funds. Got issues on the past but good thing the support team helps me to sort things out and fixed it. Highly recommended for it's very fast transactions and very minimal fees. A must have for crypto users.","Terrible way to buy BTC, first time using app tried buying BTC and all my purchases kept declining for no reason it was 1 out of 9 times it finally went though, and now I tried giving the app a second chance and went to buy some more BTC and first try the order went though but I havnt received my BTC for some reason because it's STUCK ON VERIFYING my bank was charged what needs to be verified????, it's been 4hours and I still havnt gotten my BTC, terrible app."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.bitcoin.mwallet","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bitcoin.mwallet&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Crypto App - Widgets, Alerts, News, Bitcoin Prices","description":"Keep track of all crypto coins in one app!

However, for myself, it's easy to forget exactly when things happened 8 or 9 months ago, & that's important for seasonal trends. I can look it up, & just remember, but I end up w/ a static image in mind.","An amazing app for both news and keeping up with crypto prices. The choice of alarm settings are great and the widgets that come along with the app are useful too. Highly advise buying the pro version. You get what you pay for with it.","I mainly use the app for the widgets on my homescreen, to get a quick look. This used to work like a charm.

It is cumbersome to use, they make every change without notice (Which made it impossible to access on the computer), they do not support sending anything somewhat irregular, the transaction fees are insanely expensive (Compared to setting one's own gas price), there is no way to access the wallet anywhere else and it is all a hassle.

Just enter your wallet address and you will know about every transaction!<br><br>You can use this ERC20 wallet crypto tracker to monitor multiple blockchains and know everything about yours or any other wallet. We have plans to add Favorite wallets soon, so you can add any wallet to Favorites and track all the transactions there, as in the etherscan.io, ethplorer.io, electroneum, ethersurface or etherchain. Also, Favorites will be added to Ethereum block explorer to save blocks with your transactions and show it to your friends, for example as proof of a successful ERC-20 tokens transfer. Even if you are using Ether classic tokens, you will get all the Ethereum info and stats. Soon you will be able to search and track wallets by public address and by QR-code, view wallets‚Äô balance, transaction history, transactions info, blockchain txhash and total crypto amount.","summary":"BANKEX Scan: ETH and ERC‚Äå20 tokens blockchain explorer.

The integrated blog is well written and gives useful updates on the app and general news relevant to investors. Easy read. I recommend this to cryptocurrency beginners especially. I found Luno from their ads around London and am now applying for a job with them!","Luno is a good, reliable, and efficient application. The only things I'm not happy about is that i get charged for almost every transaction I make(no matter how small), and I was hoping that a Demo account system could be implemented for the exchange. I would really appreciate it if there was also Ripple(XRP) Saving wallets. Please please please add an XRP savings wallet","been observed for 2 month for this app.the system have some cheating algorithm when you buy and sell from luno. e.g when you buying btc, the rate is expensive RM142,828 and when you quickly want to sell btc, at same time,same second(without price market change significantly at all) rate become cheaper, which is RM142,135.i have tested back n forth for many time with constant market rate, still same/not close. dont try to order me contact support or what bcoz nothing to report, this is cheating.","Usage has been smooth for some months now, until recently... I lost my device and got a new one. All efforts to login with my details have been ineffective. I mean, you guys have my email address and phone number, why so difficult to redeem my account when I have assets in there?","I love this app, it is to easy to use and user friendly. Veferification process only takes fees minutes, I can withdraws fast especially for small amounts like R500, it less than 24 hours for the funds to reflect in my account.

I gave it 4 stars because it is not completely perfect to use and navigate, transaction history does not reflect all the transactions made by me whether it is sending or receiving coins and I wish the notifications of this app is working or is it just me because I am using an older version of android 8. I hope you can fix this and overall it is a good app not great.","This has got to be the worst crypto wallet I've ever used. Tons of bugs and glitches, complicated staking procedures, and the fees are very high. On top of that I lost coins due to a problem with the wallet and customer service is simply incapable of understanding my problem or helping. My advice would be to stay away from this app.","Works well for me and I do recommend. Sometimes it takes a little time for transactions to go through but this is true for most transactions of this type. One thing to makes sure is you keep enough etherum to pay for the transaction if that is what is used for the fees. So just don't zero it out is what I am saying.","Great app for a beginner, such as myself. More up and coming coins need to be added. The ability to sell and trade coins directly thru the wallet would make it the best on the market. And if you really want to solidify #1 spot, bring the community of AWC users together like they've done on my favorite trading platform.","Great app, easy to use. So many nice features. Could use some added features. It's hard to know what your total returns on investments is since it doesn't keep track of where you stared. Haven't had great success in identifying if I've made anything on my staking crypto either.

Maybe they are just 'busy' but it's been two weeks since I submitted my ticket and I still haven't conversed with a human! Ergo, one star because the app installs. Nothing more as my BTC are still yet to be found since I 'smart' transferred them in. I would avoid this app at the present time based solely on the support experience. [edit] Support ticket#333616 has been responded to - thank you - +1 more star. [edit#2] - you mention refund but the ticket says the partner has all the info and to create a new PAYIN BTC. All very confusing. We will see. [edit#3]. They eventually refunded me, however based on this experience I still cannot recommend nor give > 2 stars - especially when they ask me to edit the review. If I had enough funds I would transfer what little BTC I have elsewhere and close the account.","For the most part I like the app alot. I transferred in out and exchanged numerous times with no problems. It's always worked smoothly before.....I sent 14.9 xrp \"with the correct tag number included\" ......and never recieved the xrp. I submitted a ticket. Waited. Then got an email saying they are backed up on tickets and are trashing all existing open tickets and to submit a new one. I did. It's been a week since I submitted the new one. Costumer Service at freewallet is a joke.","ticket ID is 315537 Update: The customer service officially provided me the things i needed to submit. And i sent their requirements, hopefully i got to access my account, finally. *Ratings may change depends on their response. Update: They fix my problem.

And why? I've never seen another app exchange ever have these issues. The date and time that was requested for payout or exchange should be honored. It was offered to the users as functional, and hasn't been the case on your end as promised.. These excuses are not acceptable. Compensation seems appropriate for start.","Apparently, the WORST app ever. Been trying to sign up since forever. I've re-installed the app severally.

I really wanted to give 5 stars but the app failed to update after a recent transaction stating that I am offline. I found that I had to clear cache then restart, for it to work properly. Therefore only 4 stars for now. EDIT: after trying the built-in exchange I have removed another star from my review. Like others described before me the fees are higher than expected. DO NOT use the exchange service.","Easy to use, high transaction fees (but that's the bitcoin miner fee, it's the same no matter what wallet is used), only thing keeping it from being 5 stars is the fact that the minimum for exchanging altcoims is 52 euro which is quite high (as in, if I want to convert BTC to etherium, I have to convert a minimum of 52 euro worth) but overall a good, safe, easy to use app.","Wallet fees are ridiculous. Total Wallet amounts sometimes freeze so you have to reload multiple times for aggregate dollar amounts to show correctly. Ain't nobody got time for that foolishness. Update 5/5/2021: Based on feedback from Jaxx I will adjust my overall rating from 2 stars to 3 stars. If Jaxx can improve the crypto aggregate so that it's more reliable I will adjust my rating again. Thank you for your feedback. That piece of information you shared is helpful for my understanding.","Not good for new users. I tried to move and then trade around $400 USD of crypto coins and it says there is not enough money to do the transaction. The money is stuck there. This apparently this is nothing to do the makers of the wallet but they could have given some indication this was the case. I am new the crypto but I has no idea it costs more than $400 to move coins to another wallet or to an exchange.

Its interface is easy to use. Great for beginners. I hope they add more coins in the future. Watch out when using the exchange. They won't return your tokens after cancellation. Beware.","Simple, clean, and source available. Beware, though. They claim only the minimum blockchain fees are assessed but the build distributed here charges multiple doge, sometimes tens or even hundreds, when Dogecoin famously only requires 1 doge for even large transactions. Where are these extra doge going? Are they going somewhere or are users simply forced to overpay? No option to edit fee. Strangely, it seems honest and correct for other coins. I use the langerhans wallet for Dogecoin anyway but it's frustrating because I'd like to recommend this one for general multi-coin use.","Says it converts DOGE, then doesn't let you. Transferred crypto over to it and now wasted a fee to do that and going to get charged for going somewhere else. This is a waste of your time, find another app, another site, anywhere that you can that will let you convert what you want to. Seems pretty dodgy to advertise something and then not do anything that you've said. The app is easy enough to use, and that's the only reason for not giving a 1, simple and basic, nothing to say there, but definitely not worth your time for trading.","Great app just having trouble getting a old account back as I don't know of the log in","Charged me a $10 fee for buying $30 of Bitcoin, then only alaws me to send half of what I put in.

Email reset won't send. App is up to date. No response other than an automated email saying there was a problem and to update. Concerned my account was compromised and whomever is having all the time in the world to steal my money and identity. AT BEST Voyager has stolen $100 plus dollars from me. DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE Once again I have to file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau.","Super easy to use. Nice to be able to fund asap unlike a lot of other exchanges or custodians. Entry to the crypto space is great. Following areas of improvement: the \"Slide/Swipe\" to buy is a bit weird as I'd prefer something like a button with less motion. The app could be made more snappier. Scrolling left/right to holdings performance is a bit weird. But aside from all that, I'm a fan of the product and business model. THE INTEREST IS JUST AWESOME üòé.","Be ready to pay a premium. You will always buy at the ask price and sell at the bid price. The difference on the app is 2-5%. So potentially u will lose 5% when you buy and when you sell. Most good exchanges the difference is way less than .05%... Here you are in the hole 10% by the time you cash out. Crypto withdrawal fees are highest in business as well.. over $40 for some tokens, compared to $2-4 for others. That said the app is very easy to use and UI is great. Worth it?- you decide","#SHIBARMY ALL THE WAY! Thanks for listing! Update: After posting my review I read others and I am confused with the latest comments. I've used Voyager for about a month and a half and it has been nothing but a great app. I have never experienced any lag on transferring fiat to and from the app. Never any issues with buying or converting crypto; no issues what so ever. Don't know what they mean, Voyager is one of the easiest apps to invest in crypto.","Started off okay. Not sure about the fees but my issue is that I can't log in or change my password due to \"internal server issues\". This has been going on for weeks now.

I appreciate the app very much as it is very helpful to keep track of my crypto assets. Hopefully with the next update I can give it 5*.","The buttons are unresponsive, and there is a long lag time. I often have to open and close the app just to get it responsive again. Also, when scrolling between portfolios, the process lags as well with a blank screen coming up when I try to scroll between portfolios instead of seeing the actual portfolio. This is highly frustrating. I would like a developer to please get in contact with me. Having to tap these buttons 10x over for just one action is really grating. Awful user experience.","Be warned: They double charged me for one deposit. And they STILL have not fixed the problem for me 2 months later. They refer me to their financial company whom then gives me the run around. Eventually they said a refund was coming but it never came. They seem very unorganized at best, and possibly fraudulent at worst. I will not be depositing another dollar into this company. I do NOT recommend them to any new users. You've been warned.","I would have to say that Blockfolio is the worst. For 3 months I've tried too get help with my account and the error codes on my account and still haven't received any help. I've tried to withdraw both cryptocurrency and USD coins and it will not let me. I've reached out to support on that as well and again, NO HELP.

I tried it at 2020 and it was all good at that time but now it is getting worse. They take 10 doge as a fee for transfer . Well as u can see 1 doge on other platforms. So as my experience this the worst app ever i have used . Its so worst that when i tried to transfer my dogecoin from cryptonator at the time when the fee was 1 doge it never happened. They failed my transfer every time and now they have just increase the doge fee.","Was working great at first but once dogecoin shot up it started having serious issues, it's been down for a month and tons of us are still waiting on a reply from you guys, your support isn't doing any supporting at all cause no one has gotten any answers, we're all left in the blind here, sooner or later you guys will have to answer for what you're doing.","Dogecoin went \"offline\" for two weeks, meaning you were unable to access your crypto, so no sending or trading. Completely ridiculous. 100% Scam Service. The value of the coin cut in half in that time. Cryptonator is NOT regulated and charges exorbitant fees. Use Binance or Coinbase instead.","I transferred my 23000 dogecoin in my another wallet in 19th May, but in my cryptonator transaction activity still showing my transaction in pending why?

Also, the loopring team is very talented and responsive.","27$ to create a wallet is a terrible model when there are far better other free wallets to utilize, such as those that allow you to partake in dapps and cost nothing to setup. I have assets pooled in the loop ring DEX using a different wallet and when eth 2.0 is released, or the gas fees lower in price, I'm pulling out. It's not user friendly, it doesn't appeal to a wide enough base.","Good wallet but do NOT set it up when eth gas is high: the ethereum fee to create this wallet can be extremely high (hundreds of dollars potentially).. if gas is high just use a more traditional wallet and connect it to exchange.loopring.io. loopring is great.","at time of writing $+1000 open account wallet, potentially re-endeavour in future however, has un-installed for now; w/out proceeding past $1000+ fee.","I really wanted to like this but ultimately felt bitter.

We appreciate your support of SparkPoint and all our apps!","comments":["I had some responsive issues inserting the pin on a 10 inch tablet and the instagram link is broken. If start a transfer and change to another app to copy the address and return I need to start again because the state is not saved. Also I tried to transfer the tokens to another wallet (Trust Wallet) and the app crashes. When I try to scan another safemoon address to send it recognizes the qrcode and decodes it but it desapears almost instantly. Also the loading when changing screen is annoying.","This is a very efficient platform with a big future. I have been very pleased with the rate at which improvements are made to any bugs. I can send and receive my tokens at a fast pace, as well as a strong sense of security. The layout of the wallet is designed expertly in the sense that it's simple to digest and maneuver. The vision that the team with SparkPoint has for the project is exciting beyond words right now. I am very excited for future announcements and added utility with this project.","App is very clean and easy to use, similar to other wallets. Works very fast and smooth. Everytime you change screen, you need to log in again (like in the bank apps) which I feel much more comfortable for security reasons. Overall very satisfied with the interface and looking forward for the following developments!","So far I can confirm that I didn't have any big issues with SparkPoint Wallet and I hope they will keep the higher safety and security standards in future and we will not be lost or stolen our cryptocurrencies. For me SparkPoint wallet is one of the best choses to keep your cryptocurrencies in safe and secure way... So, I recommend it. I love this project as a whole, and I believe huge things are coming through this Wallet!","Great App Designs, Great User Interface, and with the least Hussle. Covered both BEP-20 TOKENS and ERC-20 TOKENS so I can say it supports most of the Tokens you can find in the exchange. From the wallet itself you're able to connect to the whole SPARK ecosystem which is very great."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.sparkpoint","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sparkpoint&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"CoinMarketCap - Live Crypto Price Tracker & News","description":"The world‚Äôs #1 most-trusted cryptocurrency data authority. \r\n\r\nMarket cap & rank, prices, exchange volumes, and currency conversion!

I used to get notifications on my Price alerts and price changes in my watch list fine, with no problems. Now I don't get them anymore. In fact, when I click on the bell in the top right corner, there's a little comment that says \"turn on notifications for this app to start receiving notifications\". But when you click the button to go to your settings, guess what; they're already enabled. Very irritating. S21","I have been facing issues with this app for weeks now, 1. The chart doesn't follow the market price anymore. Sometimes, the market price for a coin with be green in color but the chart for it will be red, and vice versa. 2. This app doesn't follow the rise and fall for coins. At times, a coin might rises with 340% but the app might falls to 98% or 70% or even 100%. 3. And now, as at today, 26th of June 2021, it doesn't even open up. It only throws an error. Kindly fix this error.","I have been using this app for some time now to check prices, trends & read news articles. Then I started experiencing problems. After signing in, I got ab error message and was logged out. Or, not all the info was displaying. Very frustrating. I saw all the negative responses to similar issues and blaming latest update. On 14th I logged a bug problem. On the 16th I received an email from Juvi confirming problem resolved I checked and the app is working perfectly. Thank you for the support.","At first I gave this app five stars. Then I tried to create an account. It took five attempts before they actually sent me a verification email. And then once I tried to verify it asked me if I wanted to use local data or account data. No idea what that means. All I know is that when somebody puts you through this much of a hassle just to create an account it probably isn't worth it, so I'm bucking this down to three stars.

Worse than useless app.","So far very impressed, it's now my go-to wallet app for (mobile) polygon network use. Would be 5 stars if I could find a dark mode option and there were tabs for dapps. Also getting errors when using biometrics but works fine when using pin/pattern.","Doesn't support Polygon Mainnet like advertised. You can use ETH $$ or Binance . Unfortunate because also saw AVAX network on there but, again, doesn't support AVAX Mainnet. Seems like a decent wallet but won't be using because it offers me nothing.","One of the most extensive decentralised self custodian crypto wallets out there. Takes a little getting used to, after using centralised wallets like Coinbase (which just feels like another bank app where you don't get a lot of choice). Once you wrap your head around how it works, you realise it's pretty powerful with no lock in. Support for multichain networks, connect you wallet with any defi provider for yield farming, and my NFTs supported."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"io.stormbird.wallet","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.stormbird.wallet&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"CryptoClickers: Crypto Idle Game","description":"Make as much fake Ethereum and Bitcoin as possible!

The generators. I can no longer buy them. I should start with more than 0 from all my upgrades, and everytime my Auto generator buys them, after 1 second they reset, so I still have no generators. EDIT: It fixed itself a few days ago, so no worries! I think it was just something to do with a setting I had up. Made some good progress now!","Much better than the original. (Edit: Interesting mechanics, though I am getting some slight Antimatter Dimensions vibes with some of them. Now that I played the game a bit, I do see now that much of the game, at least what I'm up to, is centered on challenges, which makes it unique, but also repetitive.)","Great game, the menus could be cleaned up a bit to make it a bit easier to understand (mainly the server menu, also I'm not very far into the game [haven't reached Grand Hardfork yet] so there might be more menus that need the same treatment), haven't experienced any glitches or crashes yet, overall good game. Love the music by the way.","Really calm paced game, easy to maneuver, tutorial right off the start (plus info on every other main item), and easy to play in general. I feel the game may be too fast, with each bit coming and going like speed, but with the third prestige layer coming soon, that'll be nice. 5 stars."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.CryptoGrounds.CryptoClickers2","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.CryptoGrounds.CryptoClickers2&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"tokenPocket - Ethereum Wallet & Dapps Browser","description":"‚ñ† Bring DApps to your mobile\r\nYou can browse Dapps from your wallet directly.\r\n\r\n‚ñ† Safely Managed\r\nWallet just only for you\r\nFully buildable off-line\r\n\r\n‚ñ† Overview of your assets\r\nYou can see your Ehereum Tokens balance and portfolio\r\nSimply tracking your digital assets value by price of Ethereum and other Tokens(*)\r\n\r\nTokens listed on CMC (Coin Market Cap)","descriptionHTML":"‚ñ† Bring DApps to your mobile<br>You can browse Dapps from your wallet directly.<br><br>‚ñ† Safely Managed<br>Wallet just only for you<br>Fully buildable off-line<br><br>‚ñ† Overview of your assets<br>You can see your Ehereum Tokens balance and portfolio<br>Simply tracking your digital assets value by price of Ethereum and other Tokens(*)<br><br>Tokens listed on CMC (Coin Market Cap)","summary":"Dapps Browser &amp; ERC20 Tokens.

Only app I know of that can buy ravencoin, so that's cool. There was a glitch showing prices inaccurately but I think this update fixes it. The transfer of coins is confusing, because I don't like QR codes, and I hear there is like a 12-14% fee for selling coins...if that fee could be lowered, that'd be cool. If not then I'll transfer stuff to coinbase & sell for 0% fee.","The camera function is terrible. Have tried against several dark blue and black backgrounds, and it says \"use a dark background\". Therefore, can't register.","I haven't been able to use it since last update. Application doesn't even launches.","There is a serious flaw with Ravencoin. The minimum buy for Ravencoin is 1000 tokens. The maximum weekly buy is $500. So how do you buy Ravencoin when the price hits 0.501 cents? Its impossible and Ravencoin is the main token of tzero. A majority of accounts are not allowed to buy more than $500 a week till you buy more than $2500.","Can't even sign up. Get's stuck at the selfie. tried on different devices.

However, there is an annoying announcement / ad banner at start of the app every time which can only be closed with the cross button situated at the top corner of the screen. Due to the large screen phones today, closing this banner requires a two hand manoeuvre which is really poor design according to me and is also annoying to be receiving the banner in the first place. Banners should be placed in a manner that is non-obtrusive and secondly user should be able.","Awesome. It's good that many coins are added, but it's confusing. Showing different page per currency isn't comfortable. There must a single page of all coins available with current prices and even columns with what we hold of them. And then when we touch the respective coin we could see history and price chart while whatever we hold too should be shown at once and total price of what we hold too. There were no such monthly charges when i was using wazirx earlier. This rule has come later.","1. App user interface is not intuitive. 2. While doing KYC if you accidently go back, you will need to refill the info. 3. Also if KYC rejected, whole form needed to be refilled. 4. Not sure where can we see price timeline for coins. It is very important to showcase that at very main screeen. 5. While adding INR money, options provided are only mobikwik even though it shows UPI verified.","Great. Very easy to understand and invest in crypto using this App. Best app out there in market for investing in crypto. Easy to navigate and very easy to understand and you can see prices of crypto updating every second. Much impressed with this app and withdraws and deposits are very easy in this app. The charts for each individual token/coin load very slow and sometimes non responsive with no axes labels. One cannot see the trend over time on the app easily. Wish we had more data and notes.","Really, amazing! This app only has a big name else than that there is nothing about it. About a month ago I placed an order for a shoe. And I received a different product then what i had ordered for, so the very same day I requested for a exchange. Unlike other shopping site Wazirx had quiet a complicated exchange process where in we need to provide all if proof and stuff.
