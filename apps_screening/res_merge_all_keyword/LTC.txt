Is not even upto 10 or 15cent .... That is tooo poor considering the quality of the ad's and amount of ads we have to watch. Please us very very unfair. Am not happy at all this is not encouraging do something about it","It is a good free way to continuously get small amounts of Litecoin. I use the BCH app too & they r just alike, which isnt a bad thing. One improvement that could be made is in the Playwall offers...they pay good at the very first and then make u play more for less, which is backwards and make me delete games i actually liked in place for what will give more Litoshis. That could be improved...and a lot of the surveys could be too bc there's never any available and i rarely get to finish any .","App works ok but rewards are very poor and need a huge increase, 300 thousand litoshi is worth £0.30 (30 UK pennies) a 30 second add reward can earn you 100 litoshi, 15-20min surveys reward 2p and many of the surveys disqualify you or close when you're 98% complete so you get zero rewards many times. Bitlabs surveys lie and pay out 25% what they advertise at times","You won't make a ton of money but it is consistent . They also do double days. Compared to others I like how it is an actually unit. 4/8 I completed an offer but did not get anything. There are no answers Update 4/26 Playwall offer no longer works Update 5/4 I did get a response. I appreciate. I'm banned too for some reason, even though I used Google play. The developers don't control who is banned. It's the serves they use. Oh well","I've been having problems accessing the playtime offerwall since the last update. Nothing happen when i click on the link of the playtime offerwall. Have emailed the developer but no response. It used to be okay until the latest update.

It's a 1.0 version so the developer will likely make an improved version in the future. Some feedback I have for the developer is to change the claim/restart time intervals from every 30 mins (length of time to mine 1 block) to every 3 hours and have a notification alert that pops up, reminding users when to claim/restart mining. Would be great if there was a mode that would continue to mine while you're asleep. Needs both \"-\" \"X\" buttons to mimimize/close the program.","I enjoy it so far, but why does it always flip the app on my phone. So my phone can only be viewed upside down. Anyway to fix this annoying issue?

It used to be my favourites but it's basically no longer functional, so I am forced to make the switch. I'd give it 5 starts over and again if the issues were actually addressed.","Was a great app until the LTC did all the route changes September 1st, 2019 and there's been no update issued to reflect the new routes and times. if I punch you in the stops near my place, tells me there are no buses, because the route 26 does not exist anymore. It does not show buses for the route that replaced it. still works great for the routes that remains the same, unfortunately I don't take a lot of those.","The app no longer works for me since I changed my phone to Samsung Galaxy S9 around December 24th 2018.

No Buses or bus stops can be found. it just displays an empty list, even if I enter known bus stop numbers or street names. I am uninstalling the app.","Usually this app works well for down-to-the-minute bus arrival information, but all of the routes changed as of September 1st 2019 and none of the stops have been updated. I can't find a contact for the developer besides this so hopefully they see this negative review and fix it soon. Will update to positive once all the stop information has been fixed.

Maybe they are just 'busy' but it's been two weeks since I submitted my ticket and I still haven't conversed with a human! Ergo, one star because the app installs. Nothing more as my BTC are still yet to be found since I 'smart' transferred them in. I would avoid this app at the present time based solely on the support experience. [edit] Support ticket#333616 has been responded to - thank you - +1 more star. [edit#2] - you mention refund but the ticket says the partner has all the info and to create a new PAYIN BTC. All very confusing. We will see. [edit#3]. They eventually refunded me, however based on this experience I still cannot recommend nor give > 2 stars - especially when they ask me to edit the review. If I had enough funds I would transfer what little BTC I have elsewhere and close the account.","For the most part I like the app alot. I transferred in out and exchanged numerous times with no problems. It's always worked smoothly before.....I sent 14.9 xrp \"with the correct tag number included\" ......and never recieved the xrp.

It's been a week since I submitted the new one. Costumer Service at freewallet is a joke.","ticket ID is 315537 Update: The customer service officially provided me the things i needed to submit.

And why? I've never seen another app exchange ever have these issues. The date and time that was requested for payout or exchange should be honored. It was offered to the users as functional, and hasn't been the case on your end as promised.. These excuses are not acceptable. Compensation seems appropriate for start.","Apparently, the WORST app ever. Been trying to sign up since forever. I've re-installed the app severally.

A joy to interface with compared to some banks. the app is simple and elegant, is very intuitive to use.","Works pretty well and the new update has improved syncing. One improvement I suggest is to improve the user experience with syncing, since it takes a long time. If you could show progress more closely instead of updating only every few hundred blocks that would be good. Or adding an estimated time until completion might also be good.","Used to work fine on my Android phone. But XMR won't sync anymore or connect to any nodes, all show red.

I tried it at 2020 and it was all good at that time but now it is getting worse. They take 10 doge as a fee for transfer . Well as u can see 1 doge on other platforms. So as my experience this the worst app ever i have used . Its so worst that when i tried to transfer my dogecoin from cryptonator at the time when the fee was 1 doge it never happened. They failed my transfer every time and now they have just increase the doge fee.","Was working great at first but once dogecoin shot up it started having serious issues, it's been down for a month and tons of us are still waiting on a reply from you guys, your support isn't doing any supporting at all cause no one has gotten any answers, we're all left in the blind here, sooner or later you guys will have to answer for what you're doing.","Dogecoin went \"offline\" for two weeks, meaning you were unable to access your crypto, so no sending or trading. Completely ridiculous. 100% Scam Service. The value of the coin cut in half in that time. Cryptonator is NOT regulated and charges exorbitant fees. Use Binance or Coinbase instead.","I transferred my 23000 dogecoin in my another wallet in 19th May, but in my cryptonator transaction activity still showing my transaction in pending why? If system is pending from your side so please revert back my transaction. Last so many days I continues sent you reminder on your given mail id, but from your side no any response for me.

It then asked me for a username again for some reason and when i tried the previous username It said it was \"taken\" so I used a new one. The new username seemed to wipe the funds received by the older username even though I used same recoveryphrase.","You can transfer your crypto from your coinbase to your wallet and vice versa. I do wish that I could have a screen that would display what I have on coinbase inside of my wallet. I also wish that there was a way that you could convert USD coin or some other currency to another currency and pay the mining fee with the currency you are trying to convert with rather than pay with ethereum because you might not have any. And dark mode would be great. It's a good wallet so far.","I've been with Coinbase since 2017, and although the fees might be higher than other exchanges, it's very simple and smooth to use, and I never had any issues with this exchange. I earned free Crypto for simply watching videos, I earn interest on my Crypto, I can borrow, I can transfer easily, and my money is safe. Check out my website for $10 free in Bitcoin once you deposit $100.","This app is slowing down my phone. I have a Pixel 5 that doesn't have much on it. I keep it clean and don't install much. I am in cyber security and know it is not malware. Ever since I installed this app all other apps are painfully slow. I tried to force stop Coinbase Wallet and my phone's performance improved. The performance is still too slow even after stopping the app.","What a joke!!! At first they tell you you're going to get some ridiculously high interest rate by lending out your money, then somehow it ends up under 1%. Mine went from something like 11% down to .44% and has stayed there for months. To top that off the miner fees are so high it's basically impossible to get any of your money out because they're charging almost the same amount you're trying to withdraw.

Also will not allow swap between blockchains. So if you have ETH or USDT and want BTC (or visa versa) this will not work for you. Otherwise it is a nice wallet that pays interest on a few held assets (mostly BNB).","It would be the perfect wallet if it had more Binance Smart Chain coin swap options. Dapp browser conflicts with Android Web View sometimes causing loading of exchanges to slow down immensely. Support for ease of access to exchanges is incredible and top quality.

They claim only the minimum blockchain fees are assessed but the build distributed here charges multiple doge, sometimes tens or even hundreds, when Dogecoin famously only requires 1 doge for even large transactions. Where are these extra doge going? Are they going somewhere or are users simply forced to overpay? No option to edit fee. Strangely, it seems honest and correct for other coins. I use the langerhans wallet for Dogecoin anyway but it's frustrating because I'd like to recommend this one for general multi-coin use.","Says it converts DOGE, then doesn't let you. Transferred crypto over to it and now wasted a fee to do that and going to get charged for going somewhere else. This is a waste of your time, find another app, another site, anywhere that you can that will let you convert what you want to.

This app is complete trash. I try to verify my account for the thousands time and I get an email that it is completed but on the app it says it failed. I cannot buy anything. I contacted the costumer service and haven't received anything yet. Also they don't have live agents to talk to what complicates things as well. In overall this app is completely worthless and I do not trust them to pay me out if I had money on my account due to the failure of their verification system.","TNT: Hello all, this the first time that I am rating on here.

Thank you.... Update: Still doing it!...","The app is great the support is non-existent. I put money in over 3 days ago and it came out of my checking account but I still can't invest anything even though the website and the application both say as soon as you make a deposit you can start investing you just can't withdraw the funds for 10 days. my money's been in the portfolio for 3 days! you can't get a hold of a real person they only do it electronically and i guess I'm just screwed.

They don't answer the phone when I call. Now get this, you can use the same email address and password word and the system says they don't recognize my computer, email address or password. They also want me to use an email account I no longer can get into thanks to at&t. Reloading information does not wor","In my honest opinion about this app. I would say it's really cool to see the vast variety of cryptocurrencies that are out there. It is pretty easy to use. Now for the cons of this app. The app does run slow and act up sometimes. Also the huge fees the force on you everything you make any transaction between both sell and buying.

Can't get to my original wallet, when I do a recovery ( like I was instructed to) I get a new wallet with 0 balance. I email the problem to customer service and it takes them 3 months to get back to me with the exact same instructions. NOW I HAVE 4 WALLETS WITH O BALANCE!! My money is in my original which I still can't get them to give me any way to access it. Bottom line ...don't trust them with your money! I have talked to others that have the same problem. Don't trust Abra!","Nothing special about its features. The interest earning options require a KYC application with Prime Trust. My application was pending for over 2 months with no explanation. My repeated attempts to get more information resulted in automated, bot generated emails, and no action. ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE customer service!!! At least I was able to take my BTC out.","They are saying that it's wallet has it's own unique recovery phrase, but when I login in my recovery phrase I can't recover my account anymore, my investment was gone. I did my verification of identity but it stuck me, there's no way to proceed. hoping they will improve their system. I've lost my 300 Canadian dollars. it was.","Why does it all me to update my app all the time when there is no update available? They claim no fees but they get you on the spread. Comes out close to what Coinbase charges, only CB is transparent about it. I've had the app for 3 days but got a message today saying I had to update it to use it. So I go to update it. There's no update available. You can't do limit orders.","Multiple attempts over the past four months to verify KYC proved futile, even when app confirms successful completion of verification process. All requests for assistance through Abra's customer service yield no results in rectifying the issue. Not only does it take customer service, in average, three weeks to respond to inquiries, but their response is always the same; to follow the app step by step guide to complete KYC verification."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.plutus.wallet","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.plutus.wallet&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Bitcoin Smart Faucet Rotator","description":"Claim free Bitcoins with simple click without annoying AD! \r\nCoins available: BITCOIN, BITCOIN CASH, POTCOIN, ZCASH, PIVX, MONERO, STRATIS, LITECOIN, DOGECOIN, PEERCOIN, DASHCOIN, PRIMECOIN, ETHEREUM, BLACKCOIN, BITCORE, B3COIN, FEYORRA, BINANCE COIN BNB, USDT\r\nMicro payment supported: FaucetPay \r\n\r\nSimple automatic and smart rotator to earn bitcoins and crypto currencies.

The app shows one amount and PC a totally different amount even if I was to sync them at the exact time. That's probably my biggest issue. Other than that an awesome and secured wallet. Oh and it would be nice for the tokens to be updated and not have to manually put them in. That's all...","The pin security doesn't work! I lock my screen, unlock and the app is still open. What's the point in even having a pin set if you don't all for it?","I tried 20+ wallet and this is the best one. Caters both to advanced users and beginners alike, well organized and nice to look at. Most wallet software feels like either a hobby project or designed in a dungeon.

Add haptic feedback too when buttons are pressed. .... In the digit input screen, pull or bring down the keypad a bit — there's a large unused space at the bottom. EDIT: 5 stars to 3 stars. why? (1.) when you set the list of currencies to show in alphabetical order in the homepage, it resets to random order if the app is closed. (2.) The exchange rate for Naira is FALSE/WRONG. It reports double.","Love the app and simplicity however I wish I could paste my values in the calculator. I have to manually type in the value and keep having to switch back and forth between apps to get the exact number. Copy and paste would make this app 5*s.","Almost perfect, it has most coins, if not all coins I have ever needed to check the price for. I hated having to browse for exchanges to check the prices and only to find that I couldn't get the values for very small amounts.

When BTC goes down, the app automatically converts BTC to USDC and you can earn APY on USDC. There is also a BTC mining option to get free BTC!!","I love this app I love the fact that you can mine for bitcoins without having to have a supercomputer it is easy it is quick it doesn't use all your battery and it do it in the background best app ever","I love the ease of use! It makes it easy to find the right fund and also as an investor in the company it was a good choice. Simple enough for people that are not super knowledgeable on Cryptocurrency.","Great app! Makes investing easy. The only thing that's slightly annoying is that when you click on a portfolio in the invest tab, the portfolio details seem to be cut off mid-sentence for some reason.","I've been using this fund for quite some time and have found that the investment returns are great. One of the most notable things recently is that even though Bitcoin had a huge selloff and price reduction recently these guys were able to see it coming and reallocate the funds they had me invested in and my investment avoided being a part of the selloff. They've done well with taking control of my investments and gotten me great returns."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.emberfund.ember","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.emberfund.ember&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"CryptoRize - Earn Real Bitcoin","description":"*BE ADVISED: It takes a long time to earn enough Points to cash out for a meaningful amount of Bitcoin.

But its better when you increase a little bit the points we get or the withdrawal amount(like $0.2 or $0.3) since the withdrawal is every 3days, and the minimum 11,000 withdrawal amount is $0.03 only(that's 1.5days to 2days). I guess you will not lose because of the ads you put in the app. I will change my rating to 5 star if you did my suggestion.","Great app. cash outs are awesome. its like less than 5 minutes fastest in the process, for others who play their games, focusing on games alone maybe a little bit tiring and you'll get bored with small points. take your chances on surveys on the offers and amazingly you'll get higher points. pabilisan nga lang sa pag hanap ng offer sa survey and if mag qualify profile mo sa hinahanap ng survey site na nag offer ng points.. still great app also tried their other games same process no issues","You can easily withdraw your points. I've given 5 star previously but now making it to 3 star because I can't get my referral code impresse in order to invite my friends to play this game.

I did find the other apps they recommended worked faster, but they are strictly ads. So depends on if you want the game to reward you or just ads to pay you it's your choice. Either way works with coinbase and pay outs were almost instant.","I wrote a review previously saying my points did not reflect after being credited but that's because I did not wait long enough.

I really wanted to give 5 stars but the app failed to update after a recent transaction stating that I am offline. I found that I had to clear cache then restart, for it to work properly. Therefore only 4 stars for now. EDIT: after trying the built-in exchange I have removed another star from my review. Like others described before me the fees are higher than expected. DO NOT use the exchange service.","Easy to use, high transaction fees (but that's the bitcoin miner fee, it's the same no matter what wallet is used), only thing keeping it from being 5 stars is the fact that the minimum for exchanging altcoims is 52 euro which is quite high (as in, if I want to convert BTC to etherium, I have to convert a minimum of 52 euro worth) but overall a good, safe, easy to use app.","Wallet fees are ridiculous. Total Wallet amounts sometimes freeze so you have to reload multiple times for aggregate dollar amounts to show correctly. Ain't nobody got time for that foolishness. Update 5/5/2021: Based on feedback from Jaxx I will adjust my overall rating from 2 stars to 3 stars. If Jaxx can improve the crypto aggregate so that it's more reliable I will adjust my rating again. Thank you for your feedback. That piece of information you shared is helpful for my understanding.","Not good for new users. I tried to move and then trade around $400 USD of crypto coins and it says there is not enough money to do the transaction. The money is stuck there. This apparently this is nothing to do the makers of the wallet but they could have given some indication this was the case. I am new the crypto but I has no idea it costs more than $400 to move coins to another wallet or to an exchange.

This scam app is easy to recieve the cripto, but very hard to get It back or make any payments over it due to the hidden minimum amount which you can see only before the last step and which is way more then the purchase amount.

To convert your coins you must have £50-£60 worth them which is absurd. To transfer coins the fees extortionate. They say there is no hidden fees etc and its Tx fees but you can send crypto from wallets like Coinbase, Nash & Blockchain without fees that high. I'd recommend any new users to fully avoid CoinPayments unless you want a large %of your crypto gone","I can't access acct. There is no option other then scan qr.

In this update:<br>- Bug fixes &amp; improvements","comments":["I really enjoy the app! I use the card for purchases I would make like gas and snack food because you get a little CRO back so I thought why not. Buying coins is easy as well. The only part I don't really understand is the card tiers say you need a minimum staked in dollars to go up a tier, but then when I go to stake there is a minimum written in CRO or whatever other coin I've tried staking. Other than that I really enjoy the app and if you're wanting a debit card for crypto, this one works!","App is not incredibly intuitive, but it's still pretty solid. Only 3 stars because app doesn't work at all in newest version of Android beta, which is currently preventing me from accessing my investments. Reduced another star (now 2) as it's not been a month since the Android 12 beta went public and has even had an update, but this app has still not been fixed. It's the only app that I've encountered that does not work in the beta.","I purchased crypto worth $3,520. I was showing this amount but when the transaction complete I was charged a fee even though it did not show the box where I have to check it and agree to the fee. I contact customer service many times but no luck I told them it was a glitch on their end but the customer service is like a robot.. they just copy and paste.. total scam I do not recommend it. I am in a process to cancel my account.","This is the most complicated app I've ever dealt with for crypto buying selling and tracking. It's takes forever, selling and trading is extremely confusing. Only reason I am using it is ability to buy diverse coins. 1 star is very harsh, but its obvious this app is designed for the educated when it comes to crypto, people new to crypto currency would be better served going somewhere else. Trading, buying, or transferring needs to be made more simple .","Overall the app is nice, that is if you get to open it! I've been using it for 6m now and would like to see faster replies from the customer service agents and limit orders when buying coins. Ah, I didn't get my referral credit too. A bit more generous rewards for staking would be appreciated too. Other than that, it has a nice selection of coins and it's quite easy to use."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"co.mona.android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.mona.android&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"StormX: Shop and earn or play and earn free crypto","description":"🛍️  Shop at your favorite stores and earn free Bitcoin or Ethereum.

The app is atrocious for shopping/browsing stores through the app. Can't get logged into some stores, can't navigate on others. Back button will have you starting over, etc.","It's a good concept, but the past few times I've played games to get rewards, the reward disappears before I'm able to complete it. It'll say in the rules \"within 20 days of installing\" and I'll go check on the status within 7, and the reward info isn't even available. This has happened to me twice. It doesn't even store it in my history. I'm frustrated.","Ordered some things on Aliexpress. At first, I thought it didn't work, but in a week or so the points showed up for my purchases. Good app, good concept. Can be improved, of course but going in the right direction.","Pretty cool to earn crypto rewards for shopping and playing games on ur phone! When I had an issue receiving a reward, customer service was responsive and resolved the issue quickly. Excites for the debit card launch!!!","So far it works for me as advertised, I find the browser extension easier to shop with but the phone app is nice for quick things.

I also don't understand why the web version has a totally different cx compared to mobile. On mobile, I have a hard time setting a limit price and the cursor won't select the limit price text box. Not to mention the lack of basis portfolio visualization features and the fact we have two different apps from the same company.","Very disappointing app. I thought pro meant it was going to give me a lot of control over charts and indicators, but it's way too basic. I tried Binance and it provides a rich experience with a lot of customizability. I can actually zoom in and out and drag charts around, rather than this which is just fixed. Not trader friendly at all.","Absolutely horrible platform! I had $110 in Eth and tried to withdrawal some to pay someone. Turns out the authenticator had issues, I had to get my account unlocked, now I can't withdraw my money. Customer service is non-existent with coin base either. I can't reach anyone and my support tickets continue to get rejected. If I could speak with someone that could help me resolve this issue then i would be ok with the situation. Do yourself a favor and use another platform like Gemini or binance.","Garbage! Constantly freezing, especially when switching between apps. Constantly getting logged out and when I try to log back in I get a rate limit exceeded message that even by changing password I still can't log in and get same error, waited about an hour, uninstalled and still no progress. Trying to log on through web browser and it just loads and loads with the same stupid blue lines just chilling in the middle of the screen with no progress.

I like that I can pass the time and generate passive income. I haven't tried to withdraw yet, but only because it says you can earn 5% if you have over 35k in coin. Sounds good to me. I will only change this rating if it for some reason doesn't allow me to withdraw my earned btc. Anyway, enjoying the app and happy to make some dough. Thanks Cointiply!","At first it was very good. Playtime was brilliant. I hardly change the device because the other one had a problem. This was said on both devices at once: this is not compatible with my device. 5 minutes before there were no problems. Even after I reset the cache and the GAID, it is not possible the support just says that my phone is not compatible. 5 minutes before everything works, you are simply fobbed off, and that after 4-5 days until you get an answer in support gets a shame. And i see it coming an standard answer here who says plz reset the GAID and Cache -.- or plz contact our support (that what i have done before i make the review.","This is one of the better sites to make a few dollars. They pay very well (relatively) to play their app games. I admit the games are just boring luck based ones, but still, they pay pretty well. The hourly roll for free coin is more data intensive than other apps and the capcha is a bit of a pain, but it's free. I also like the idea that they pay interest if you have 35k coin balance. I've made about $10 in coin in two weeks.","Great site, I just wish the surveys were more available to get. *edit: Thanks for the response :D another great reason to like this site!.

Used to be good. Then they removed nano, which made sense at the time because of the spam attack. Then it got fixed but nano never returned. You can now ONLY withdraw bitcoin and it's worth like one third the amount you used to get. The \"latest updates\" you see on the google play page is false advertising, front and center. Don't know why they get away with it. Cherry on top - the support team has called it quits.","Used to be good, now insanely low rewards and forces you to pay the BTC miner fees, so you get next to nothing after a ton of work.","Pretty good app, at least it used to be before the pointless (pun intended) update where the points earned no longer go towards Nano currency. Now it's only super inflated Bitcoin where earnings are so low that you couldn't afford even a can of beans after what you would make in a month's time. Not too happy but devs use this comment and take it as a learning experience. Fix your app. You will have my patience and kindness.","Not bad for the type of app it is. Avoid Pollfish surveys as they will lead you through a full length survey then not reward anything. InBrain surveys are hit or miss whether they reward anything at all leading them to be a time sink. Theorem Reach surveys will typically award at least something. The other app related opportunities pretty much don't reward anything. Update: seems all the surveys are now done by Lucid, which requires a lot of unnecessary cookies allowing them to track too much.","3 stars - I've had a lot of fun in the past year with this app, I've made over 50$ btc in my free time playing games, just make sure whichever offer wall you use has a customer support section. When points don't come through you have to email the offer wall for customer service. You also have to email Quicrypto customer service if you need to change your wallet address [annoying, but they are nice and helpful] these days the app is glitchy and good offers are hard to find.

It works properly less than 10% of the time, often making you do 6-8 times each because it doesn't properly recognize your respinse or it is just flat out wrong ( case in point, a pic of an RV was displayed and it thought it was a bus).

Exactly what I was looking for. But unfortunately, the android version is buggy. Paid version findings. 1) crashes pretty consistently, esp. when navigating portfolios. 2) holding view option, often freezes, or crashes.

Update: prices are about 10 minutes delayed. Kinda useless.","I'm super impressed with this app, they have very good accurate charts for low cap coins, as well as the popular ones.

I also wish I had the option to mine all 3 options at once even if this where an upgrade only feature.

You have to get verified and it can take up to 10 days however it stated you can request to send it through the platform to speed it up. Within that timline you'd have to wait to cash out which can take up to 5 business days. I read how to avoid losing Satoshi bc it is how the user manipulate the app opposite of what the developers recommendation bc support helped me with the issue.","Great mining App, I've mined before, weeks on end, month after month, after 90 days I couldn't even visit the dollar store.

Will update if fixed. Email many times, messaged from the dashboard on website and put in multiple requests for missing Satoshi and not fixed. They keep taking the Satoshi that their customers accumulate on their app. You build up 10,000 plus sat on any or multiple tabs on the app one day it's gone. And they do not respond except to send you an email to update your wallet info. Scam","So. It's nice seeing numbers run at the toppa ya screen, but I been waiting for my “pending” request to be completed for about 14 days now. It's getting annoying.

Even when you manually force update a coin price, you would see the gain/loss percent change but not the actual price. Kinda defeats the entire purpose unless you just wanted a general idea of how the currency is doing. 2) I couldn't figure out how to add more than one coin tracker.

I decided to go with another app.","This app is great, I own a bunch of different crypto coins from several apps this gives me customizable widgets that let me track the value of my coins without having to open each exchange. My only issue with it is sometimes the connection fails and I'm not able to track for a bit. It does lag behind a bit, but as I'm not day trading this isn't a problem for me.","Exactly the widget I wanted, but I'd like to see some updates. It would be nice if I could add a label to each coin. I hold crypto for various family members and would like to label each widget with their names.

If you're going to mess around on Candy Crush, why not get paid for it? I've made some decent cash off of this and it's funding my smaller crypto investments. Yeah, there's ads. You get used to them, especially once you know how long they last. Just put the tv on and look up when an ad comes on. Great app, wish there were more like it.","Pays out easily and quickly with coinbase. 5 stars. The game is fun. BUT!!! constantly glitches and you have to start over. I was just on a roll, my best game. Start of level 6, a flash, and im back at level 1, and my coins are gone! You still get credit for ETH. But its totally deflating, and makes people stop playing. IF THE GAME STOPPED CRASHING ID GIVE 5 STARS AND PLAY MORE. VERY DISAPPOINTED","Sure enough, it pays out Ethereum almost instantly. It's kind of hard to get figured out, though. You need to go into where it says redeem in order to get it sent to your wallet. Doesn't add up fast at all, but it's an all right time waster. And tons of ads, but that should be a given for anyone looking at this kind of thing. I'd love to see a cleaner interface and more information about how much is paid out per point, but that's easy enough to figure out."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.mansoon.cryptopop","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mansoon.cryptopop&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"LitecoinCalculator","description":"Litecoin is a peer-to-peer Internet currency that enables instant, near-zero cost payments to anyone in the world.
