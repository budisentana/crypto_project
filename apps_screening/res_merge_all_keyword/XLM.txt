Some coins do work, like Bitcoin, but BCH was transferred to this wallet and even after checking the block explorer and seeing that there were 50 confirmations, still no log of the transfer even after 7 hours. People in the U.S. need to keep track of this for tax purposes but it's not too reliable. I'm not sure about all of the coins but LTC is another one that should be examined. Thanks.","Works well keeping in mind its Binance on the Binance blockchains. It does Ethereum Mainnet as well, but will not allow DEX between blockchains. Also will not allow swap between blockchains. So if you have ETH or USDT and want BTC (or visa versa) this will not work for you. Otherwise it is a nice wallet that pays interest on a few held assets (mostly BNB).","It would be the perfect wallet if it had more Binance Smart Chain coin swap options. Dapp browser conflicts with Android Web View sometimes causing loading of exchanges to slow down immensely. Support for ease of access to exchanges is incredible and top quality. In App Price chart is slow to reflect real-time value and tends to lag behind the real time value of coins 9/10 times. In App buy minimum to fund the wallet is painfully high most times. Suggest sending funds to wallet from elsewhere","So far My experience using the trust wallet app has been very good I must admit.... BUT, BUT, BUT your continuous habit of deleting users transaction history/ID everytime the app is updated is a big FAILURE , y'all really need to find a solution to this issue... There isn't any backup feature which allows TX history/ID to be saved & this can be a big issue for many users from different parts of the globe.... As a early user of TW having access to my TX history/ID is very important .... Pls Fix","I was initially a little upset with Trust Wallet because of some issues I was having, but they have great customer service! Now that I know how to fully use the app, it is very easy and I like it. Edit: I lowered my review to 3 stars. I have used a lot of crypto apps and this is definitely the most difficult one to use.

One improvement I suggest is to improve the user experience with syncing, since it takes a long time. If you could show progress more closely instead of updating only every few hundred blocks that would be good. Or adding an estimated time until completion might also be good.","Used to work fine on my Android phone. But XMR won't sync anymore or connect to any nodes, all show red.

Entry to the crypto space is great. Following areas of improvement: the \"Slide/Swipe\" to buy is a bit weird as I'd prefer something like a button with less motion. The app could be made more snappier. Scrolling left/right to holdings performance is a bit weird. But aside from all that, I'm a fan of the product and business model. THE INTEREST IS JUST AWESOME 😎.","Be ready to pay a premium. You will always buy at the ask price and sell at the bid price. The difference on the app is 2-5%. So potentially u will lose 5% when you buy and when you sell. Most good exchanges the difference is way less than .05%... Here you are in the hole 10% by the time you cash out. Crypto withdrawal fees are highest in business as well.. over $40 for some tokens, compared to $2-4 for others. That said the app is very easy to use and UI is great.

This one pays out and is fun to play. For kids this is a good vocabulary builder. For adults this keeps the mind sharp. For a bonus you get to cash out Satoshi. So far I have been paid out 3 times, though it sometimes requires multiple attempts to submit the payout request. Also the limit seems to be 200 Satoshi before it stops accruing, perhaps that limit will be lifted after this review. Payout can be made every 72 hours. Hopefully the payout limit is lifted. Will update if so. B+","I reached the max of 200 satoshi before you have to cash out to earn more. I went to claim and had to do a reCAPTCHA which is not a problem. The problem is when i did it and selected all the correct boxes it said i was blocked. I am not a robot. With every other thing I've had to do a reCAPTCHA with, if it thinks you've made a mistake it gives you another chance. This app does not. I ended up uninstalling and reinstalling to try to make it work. It caused me to lose all the satoshi I earned.","Good game to play as you relax to go to sleep. However, very disappointed that you can only collect 200 now. It use to be 2000. When I first started playing this game it was 1000. Got excited that it was raised to 2000, but a year late it get dropped by 90%. Big bummer.","Have cashed out successfully in the past but now getting \"invalid data -3\" error. The cap was also lowered and previously it gave out BCH when BTC was promised. Other apps by this dev still working well for me.","App really pay out your win. The game is fun and you can get a small amount of BTC just for have fun to play. The payment go straight to your wallet, fast and easy. I recommend the app to everybody that wants to gain a little of crypto while having fun. Keep doing a wonderful job devs...

I find myself sitting down for a quick 5-10 game and an hour later I'm still playing. It really does pay out, instantly ! EDIT : 07-25-21 The game used to be 5 stars, now it's a weak 3 star game. Adds have increased 100%. I just scored 32000+ and for that effort, I was given 675 gwei ?!! A score like that should have paid out 4x that amount. Come on team, don't get cheap on us, the price of Ethereum is down. The payout SHOULD GO UP !!!!!!","Does what it says it does. Great mindless game for meetings or when watching TV. If you're going to mess around on Candy Crush, why not get paid for it? I've made some decent cash off of this and it's funding my smaller crypto investments. Yeah, there's ads. You get used to them, especially once you know how long they last. Just put the tv on and look up when an ad comes on. Great app, wish there were more like it.","Pays out easily and quickly with coinbase. 5 stars. The game is fun. BUT!!! constantly glitches and you have to start over. I was just on a roll, my best game. Start of level 6, a flash, and im back at level 1, and my coins are gone! You still get credit for ETH. But its totally deflating, and makes people stop playing. IF THE GAME STOPPED CRASHING ID GIVE 5 STARS AND PLAY MORE. VERY DISAPPOINTED","Sure enough, it pays out Ethereum almost instantly. It's kind of hard to get figured out, though. You need to go into where it says redeem in order to get it sent to your wallet. Doesn't add up fast at all, but it's an all right time waster. And tons of ads, but that should be a given for anyone looking at this kind of thing. I'd love to see a cleaner interface and more information about how much is paid out per point, but that's easy enough to figure out.","So it pays, I like it. Game play is a little slow, a lot of ads (which is how you make money on this game, stop complaining!) But my main issue I'd that everytime I have a good streak going, the app closes or minimizes on its own and doesn't let me return to the game at hand. I have to start over, which is kinda frustrating. If that didn't happen multiple times a week I'd be willing to up the stars."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.mansoon.cryptopop","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mansoon.cryptopop&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Edge - Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero, Ripple Wallet","description":"Total privacy and security in our easy to use blockchain cryptocurrency wallet.

I click a few buttons and I'm done, then I just site back and wait.","After trying this app is waste of time. They make you advertise for them for free but you won't get anything at all. I did try so many times even though they said rewards will be deposited but nothing after weeks. Looks like a professional scam!!! NOT RECOMMEND!! *** By the way, all 5 stars reviews are unreal because they make you to give them 5 stat in order to receive rewards but your don't get anything, and they get high reviews!!!","Not for me because To get those airdrops ,U don't just have to register with all those sites (which means U'll end up with too many sites, an Unmanageable amount of sites...😡) ,U usually also have to advertise for them Alot (to be in the top 10 or referees -To get that token' airdrop)....","I like your app. It's smooth and does what is says.

Maybe they are just 'busy' but it's been two weeks since I submitted my ticket and I still haven't conversed with a human! Ergo, one star because the app installs. Nothing more as my BTC are still yet to be found since I 'smart' transferred them in. I would avoid this app at the present time based solely on the support experience. [edit] Support ticket#333616 has been responded to - thank you - +1 more star. [edit#2] - you mention refund but the ticket says the partner has all the info and to create a new PAYIN BTC. All very confusing. We will see. [edit#3]. They eventually refunded me, however based on this experience I still cannot recommend nor give > 2 stars - especially when they ask me to edit the review. If I had enough funds I would transfer what little BTC I have elsewhere and close the account.","For the most part I like the app alot. I transferred in out and exchanged numerous times with no problems. It's always worked smoothly before.....I sent 14.9 xrp \"with the correct tag number included\" ......and never recieved the xrp. I submitted a ticket. Waited. Then got an email saying they are backed up on tickets and are trashing all existing open tickets and to submit a new one. I did. It's been a week since I submitted the new one. Costumer Service at freewallet is a joke.","ticket ID is 315537 Update: The customer service officially provided me the things i needed to submit.

And why? I've never seen another app exchange ever have these issues. The date and time that was requested for payout or exchange should be honored. It was offered to the users as functional, and hasn't been the case on your end as promised.. These excuses are not acceptable. Compensation seems appropriate for start.","Apparently, the WORST app ever. Been trying to sign up since forever. I've re-installed the app severally.

They claim only the minimum blockchain fees are assessed but the build distributed here charges multiple doge, sometimes tens or even hundreds, when Dogecoin famously only requires 1 doge for even large transactions. Where are these extra doge going? Are they going somewhere or are users simply forced to overpay? No option to edit fee. Strangely, it seems honest and correct for other coins.

So you can't add again, or move assets","Most secure app out there because it won't even let you trade after setting up an account that uses your SSN and other secret personal data. You MUST install either Duo Mobile or Google Authenticator in order to trade. The only issue that is giving me problems is that you must exit the app in order to open the authenticator app to plug-in a code and receive a pin#. You then open Bitstamp to enter the pin#. When I open Bitstamp, the pin is denied because the code changes everytime I open the app.","OK app, I find it awkward to adjust the charts using pinch & zoom. Still very useful & UI simple to use. When logging in after updating password the dark theme resets to light. APP NOT CONNECTING TODAY! Reinstalled app - now logged in.","The app is cool but I'd like it to keep track of gains and losses. Furthermore, if you did something different you'd add more customers like allowing recurring buys, direct deposit paychecks or even something like Acorns spare change round-up.","Everything was working ok then the app decided to stop using biometric for no reason.

Can't recommend this exchange for people looking to trade","Everything was great, at first. However, the last 3 days that I've been on has been a nightmare! The service will freeze up (Android, iPhone, website) and it has caused me to liquidate 3 times now! I've lost over $1,000 due to this \"glitch\", so just beware! :Edit: Edit: It has been several weeks with no response. I've reached out again and was told that my ticket would hopefully get expedited soon. That was a week ago. I don't think anyone is trying to help me.","Liked the app until I saw you can't withdrawal money very easy at all. The minimum is high to be able to transfer. I feel like that's how people steal people's money. I hate putting bad reviews. I'm going to change it once you've changed that. If I put my money anywhere I shouldn't have to withdrawal 200 just to get my money out.

In this update:<br>- Bug fixes &amp; improvements","comments":["I really enjoy the app! I use the card for purchases I would make like gas and snack food because you get a little CRO back so I thought why not. Buying coins is easy as well. The only part I don't really understand is the card tiers say you need a minimum staked in dollars to go up a tier, but then when I go to stake there is a minimum written in CRO or whatever other coin I've tried staking. Other than that I really enjoy the app and if you're wanting a debit card for crypto, this one works!","App is not incredibly intuitive, but it's still pretty solid. Only 3 stars because app doesn't work at all in newest version of Android beta, which is currently preventing me from accessing my investments. Reduced another star (now 2) as it's not been a month since the Android 12 beta went public and has even had an update, but this app has still not been fixed. It's the only app that I've encountered that does not work in the beta.","I purchased crypto worth $3,520. I was showing this amount but when the transaction complete I was charged a fee even though it did not show the box where I have to check it and agree to the fee. I contact customer service many times but no luck I told them it was a glitch on their end but the customer service is like a robot.. they just copy and paste.. total scam I do not recommend it. I am in a process to cancel my account.","This is the most complicated app I've ever dealt with for crypto buying selling and tracking. It's takes forever, selling and trading is extremely confusing. Only reason I am using it is ability to buy diverse coins. 1 star is very harsh, but its obvious this app is designed for the educated when it comes to crypto, people new to crypto currency would be better served going somewhere else. Trading, buying, or transferring needs to be made more simple .","Overall the app is nice, that is if you get to open it! I've been using it for 6m now and would like to see faster replies from the customer service agents and limit orders when buying coins. Ah, I didn't get my referral credit too. A bit more generous rewards for staking would be appreciated too. Other than that, it has a nice selection of coins and it's quite easy to use."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"co.mona.android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.mona.android&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Coinbase Wallet — Crypto Wallet & DApp Browser","description":"Coinbase Wallet is the #1 mobile crypto wallet and Web 3 DApp browser.

I created an account a month ago and mined coin to the wallet address associated to that account. I then got a new phone, dled this app to the new phone and used recovery phrase to log in.

The new username seemed to wipe the funds received by the older username even though I used same recoveryphrase.","You can transfer your crypto from your coinbase to your wallet and vice versa. I do wish that I could have a screen that would display what I have on coinbase inside of my wallet. I also wish that there was a way that you could convert USD coin or some other currency to another currency and pay the mining fee with the currency you are trying to convert with rather than pay with ethereum because you might not have any. And dark mode would be great. It's a good wallet so far.","I've been with Coinbase since 2017, and although the fees might be higher than other exchanges, it's very simple and smooth to use, and I never had any issues with this exchange. I earned free Crypto for simply watching videos, I earn interest on my Crypto, I can borrow, I can transfer easily, and my money is safe. Check out my website for $10 free in Bitcoin once you deposit $100.","This app is slowing down my phone. I have a Pixel 5 that doesn't have much on it. I keep it clean and don't install much. I am in cyber security and know it is not malware. Ever since I installed this app all other apps are painfully slow. I tried to force stop Coinbase Wallet and my phone's performance improved.

Had deposited INR but it hasn't reflected in my coindcx account yet. Raised request tickets, dropped mails, sent bank statements - no response. And I've been patient, this happened on the 29th of May. I'm not even sure what the situation is as there is no response. Ticket number: 499777 Issue still not resolved. It's been over a month.","Don't use this misleading app, Even after raising multiple tickets #529893, #527566, #541230 and #526988, I didn't recieve my money back they are misleading the customers and stealing money from them. The worst app ever, would give zero starts if there was an option. Edit-still didn't receive my money worst service ever.","In terms of interface the app is fantastic. This app can be a good starter for the beginners who are entering into the crypto market. Also, they are not charging any transaction fee as of now apart from mobiqwick. The major drawback that i faced is regarding the inr deposit. It took around 5 days to get reflected in my wallet. And right now they have removed the option as well. If the payment issue is resolved by providing instant option i personelly don't hesistate to give 5 stars.","There are alot of problems with this app: 1. Deposits are only possible with Mobiquick app and they usually charge 1.5% fee + 0.1% fee on every trade. 2. Deposits are not available or show some error 30% of the time and are not there when price of crypto drops 3. Support system is horrible and don't expect to get your problem fixed with a request. 4. Currencies like Dogecoin and Polkadot CANNOT be withdrawn and used so you don't even own some of the currencies.","The app has proven to be a failure when it comes to incorporating different payment methods. Suddenly they have taken away the UPI option. I wanted to buy the dip but couldn't do so.

I didn't know you could pull up from either portfolio screen for an additional menu - nothing to indicate that was possible until I did so by accident. Also, certain non-stable coins do not update and remain static - namely cosmos and algorand. There could be others but they are not in my portfolio.","Having used many portfolio tracking apps, this is by far the best looking one I've used.

I will only change this rating if it for some reason doesn't allow me to withdraw my earned btc. Anyway, enjoying the app and happy to make some dough. Thanks Cointiply!","At first it was very good. Playtime was brilliant. I hardly change the device because the other one had a problem. This was said on both devices at once: this is not compatible with my device. 5 minutes before there were no problems. Even after I reset the cache and the GAID, it is not possible the support just says that my phone is not compatible. 5 minutes before everything works, you are simply fobbed off, and that after 4-5 days until you get an answer in support gets a shame. And i see it coming an standard answer here who says plz reset the GAID and Cache -.- or plz contact our support (that what i have done before i make the review.","This is one of the better sites to make a few dollars. They pay very well (relatively) to play their app games. I admit the games are just boring luck based ones, but still, they pay pretty well. The hourly roll for free coin is more data intensive than other apps and the capcha is a bit of a pain, but it's free. I also like the idea that they pay interest if you have 35k coin balance. I've made about $10 in coin in two weeks.","Great site, I just wish the surveys were more available to get. *edit: Thanks for the response :D another great reason to like this site!. I was just getting a lot of sad face emojis & \"this survey isn't for you\" Everything else seems so well balanced and even entertaining, keep up the great work!","This WAS a great app until the survey issues (see previous review) but hey, the games were working great until about 10 minutes ago when I took a break and now can't play them anymore due to \"device not supported\". Are you kidding me?? I was literally JUST playing without any issues!!! Fix this problem ASAP so I can get back to earning!! My phone has been checked thoroughly and there is no problem on my end...Cointiply is either throttling or has some compatibility issues on their end."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.cointiply.earn.bitcoin","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cointiply.earn.bitcoin&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Ripple XRP Faucet","description":"Earn Ripple (XRP) effortlessly and quickly.

In this update:<br>- Bug fixes &amp; improvements","comments":["I really enjoy the app! I use the card for purchases I would make like gas and snack food because you get a little CRO back so I thought why not. Buying coins is easy as well. The only part I don't really understand is the card tiers say you need a minimum staked in dollars to go up a tier, but then when I go to stake there is a minimum written in CRO or whatever other coin I've tried staking. Other than that I really enjoy the app and if you're wanting a debit card for crypto, this one works!","App is not incredibly intuitive, but it's still pretty solid. Only 3 stars because app doesn't work at all in newest version of Android beta, which is currently preventing me from accessing my investments. Reduced another star (now 2) as it's not been a month since the Android 12 beta went public and has even had an update, but this app has still not been fixed. It's the only app that I've encountered that does not work in the beta.","I purchased crypto worth $3,520. I was showing this amount but when the transaction complete I was charged a fee even though it did not show the box where I have to check it and agree to the fee. I contact customer service many times but no luck I told them it was a glitch on their end but the customer service is like a robot.. they just copy and paste.. total scam I do not recommend it. I am in a process to cancel my account.","This is the most complicated app I've ever dealt with for crypto buying selling and tracking. It's takes forever, selling and trading is extremely confusing. Only reason I am using it is ability to buy diverse coins. 1 star is very harsh, but its obvious this app is designed for the educated when it comes to crypto, people new to crypto currency would be better served going somewhere else. Trading, buying, or transferring needs to be made more simple .","Overall the app is nice, that is if you get to open it! I've been using it for 6m now and would like to see faster replies from the customer service agents and limit orders when buying coins. Ah, I didn't get my referral credit too. A bit more generous rewards for staking would be appreciated too. Other than that, it has a nice selection of coins and it's quite easy to use."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"co.mona.android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.mona.android&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Stellar XLM Market Watch","description":"Crypto Currency\r\nStellar Live Price Manager\r\nStellar Market Watch\r\nHas a simple yet interactive UI with various options\r\nCrypto Currency\r\nCrypto Currency\r\n1)Stellar Calculator\r\n2)Stellar Current Price\r\n3)Stellar My Assets\r\nCrypto Currency\r\nStellar Calculator allows you to calculate the exact amount of stellar XLM you can buy with any amount you have.

Really slow and inefficient customer service . My money is apparently stuck now.","Good app,but has some disadvantages. When you want to sell crypto, app will sell it lower than actual market price. You loose. When you want to set a limit order, it gives you EUR currency, but I want to set in USD! Since I trade BTC/USD, not BTC/EUR! When you buy crypto, app buys it higher than standard market price, possible they create price gap + app takes big commission. Limit orders are very inconvenient and useless.","Would be better if it supported deposits and withdrawals with all the currencies it offers and not just 4 or 5, but the fees for sending/withdrawing bitcoin are a total rob so I don't know if I'd even use it. Sent out €40 worth of bitcoin and got charged €8. That's 20%. Besides that, it's a decent lite trading app.","The app has so many bugs I have to reinstall it basically every day. The most recent one is that I cannot get past the enter pass code screen. To gain access I have to delete the app and then install a fresh one.","The app is very unstable. Completely agree with previous comments. Needs rebooting practically every day. Also, KYC is taken to the extreme making deposits a pain. I hold less than a quarter funds I had originally planned.

Interest rates are quite competitive and having a lot of options is nice: earn in kind/Nexo, hold Nexo loyalty levels, and a higher locked monthly rate. Have not withdrew yet but reviews say it should be ok, faster than Blockfi at least (but KYC is required for reasonable amounts). Daily compounded interest vs weekly/monthly. App is ok. Text is not clear/scaling issues. GUI is confusing as you're not sure what can be tapped (almost everything can be). Web app is good though.","Worthless app Really cloud flare recaptcha inside the app!? How a company with so much money isn't able to deliver a ok user experience?!

It a great way to keep a general idea of what's going on without having to sit down with my spreadsheets. Unfortunately it doesn't update well and the open trades from most exchanges won't show up. If they do, it's only for BTC. Love this app, don't get me wrong. It's just needs some improvement and I cannot wait for it. (Paid user)","Overall great app and easy to use. But there is a bug in the Custom Alert when you edit the notes in what Coin and save it, the notes from other Coin appears to a different Coin. So I have to refresh it or go to a different tab then switch back to make it look how it should be. I also hope to have an option to add a device since I use two devices to keep track the whole day. There is also some needs for improvement when updating the main, and including graphs in the widget.","I used the free version for a couple of days, and felt like the pro would have some edge. Boy, how wrong was I, it's fantastic! You can connect it to all your wallets, exchanges, websites, etc. And have a holistic view of detailed one on your cryptos and portfolio. Now I can easily know, where I'm losing or making money. I highly recommend this app. Worth every penny, especially if you consider the competition that offers less of more money.","Really great app! I like the ability to get a complete view of my portfolios without having to go to each individual exchange app. The daily (customizable time) report is really cool too! I've been using it for around 4 months now without any issues. I highly recommend CoinStats!!! 👍","My sister likes this app so I thought I'd try it. She has an Apple phone & her app alerts settings offers a sound option so she uses \"Choo choo\" sound to not miss any alerts. I have a Samsung Note 20 Ulltra but the app doesn't offer any sound options. We're both using free option so far. Does anyone know why? 3 stars because of this but I'll update if resolved."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.coinstats.crypto.portfolio","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coinstats.crypto.portfolio&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"YouHodler - Crypto and Bitcoin Wallet","description":"The most advanced wallet where you can HODL and earn interest at the same time.\r\n\r\n• Crypto Wallet: Securely store digital assets on individual wallets.\r\n\r\n• Savings Account: Tired of nearly zero interest rates at banks?

Makes investing easy. The only thing that's slightly annoying is that when you click on a portfolio in the invest tab, the portfolio details seem to be cut off mid-sentence for some reason.","I've been using this fund for quite some time and have found that the investment returns are great. One of the most notable things recently is that even though Bitcoin had a huge selloff and price reduction recently these guys were able to see it coming and reallocate the funds they had me invested in and my investment avoided being a part of the selloff.

SoFi does not respond to emails at all, ever. It took a public Twitter message to get a response, and then they didn't even try to help me with it, just your pre-packaged \"we've forwarded the issue to our engineers!\" because that's ever true of any company. Unfortunately SoFi doesn't actually want your business, so better to go elsewhere.","I like having information on my cash, savings, credit, and investment accounts all in one place is nice. The tiles are a bit overwhelming at times though, something a little more minimalist and clean with a clear path to certain aspects of the app would be great. I occasionally feel lost when navigating through Relay and Money. The spending snapshot for relay is great, but I would like to be able to set spending budgets for each category in the future. Good app, great company.","I've done a few reviews on this app, but I felt the need to start fresh. This app is frustrating. They keep adding features, except those to to actually improve the app. There are no graphs to track your portfolio performance and you cannot do Stop loss orders or anything more advanced than a limit order. Also, the graphs on the stocks themselves rarely load. Just a spinning loading image. I'm continuously looking at other brokerages.","I actually really like this app, it's really user-friendly. You can learn as you go...and it's always being updated so there's fresh information everyday I absolutely have to say that this is my favorite app!💖💗 I have referred it to everyone I know on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. When you find something good you just gotta share!😇 Hey ,I hope you check this...I referred a friend but didn't get credit 😕 nor did my friend 😔 did we do something wrong?? Please help us if you can.","So I'm going to revisit my overall thinking of this bank SOFI- after utilizing some of the features and really diving into the APP, I can see a good thing, still have an issue with adding to my account, and there is still to much to follow on the \"FEED\", but, I found them to be more in depth then I had initially thought.

I think they need to make it more clear that those arrows on the side are the send and receive buttons. I think they should also display your balance first before they show the price of the cryptocurrency. What I mean is that instead of having to switch to see your balance I think you should have to switch to see the price of what ever cryptocurrency you are on. Other than those two things the app is amazing! 😄👏🏼","This wallet is all we need. More and more coins are added and the best part is that this wallet is user friendly. I highly suggest to use their desktop wallet for best experience. Their support is also superb. I can still remember when I had some issues with my deposits way back in 2017, they were helpful and very professional. Keep it up exodus, cheers!","Slider shows wrong value when you are at 6 months scope - how can be peak of a price graph be 30 while the dip is 50? I do remember when I bought but it is about money it really shouldn't show wrong values. Nice design. I would like to see auto note about price when I did recive or send. And my average - just a lil bit of analytics. ( any price graph has this bug - it is more apparent with scope 1+ month)","The app is indeed very convenient; its design is well suited for everyday crypto needs, however the problem on my phone (which is running Android 8.1) is that the app requires more CPU and RAM resources than the phone is okay dealing with, which results in a significant delay when loading the UI screen for each requested functionality; in short - it's slow. Other than that it's a great tool to have. For legit advice on acquiring Bitcoin with zero investment see cb.run/earn-bitcoin-free","Exodus is by far the best wallet when it comes to UI/UX.

Tons of bugs and glitches, complicated staking procedures, and the fees are very high.

My advice would be to stay away from this app.","Works well for me and I do recommend. Sometimes it takes a little time for transactions to go through but this is true for most transactions of this type. One thing to makes sure is you keep enough etherum to pay for the transaction if that is what is used for the fees. So just don't zero it out is what I am saying.","Great app for a beginner, such as myself. More up and coming coins need to be added. The ability to sell and trade coins directly thru the wallet would make it the best on the market.

I also don't understand why the web version has a totally different cx compared to mobile. On mobile, I have a hard time setting a limit price and the cursor won't select the limit price text box. Not to mention the lack of basis portfolio visualization features and the fact we have two different apps from the same company.","Very disappointing app. I thought pro meant it was going to give me a lot of control over charts and indicators, but it's way too basic. I tried Binance and it provides a rich experience with a lot of customizability. I can actually zoom in and out and drag charts around, rather than this which is just fixed. Not trader friendly at all.","Absolutely horrible platform! I had $110 in Eth and tried to withdrawal some to pay someone. Turns out the authenticator had issues, I had to get my account unlocked, now I can't withdraw my money. Customer service is non-existent with coin base either. I can't reach anyone and my support tickets continue to get rejected. If I could speak with someone that could help me resolve this issue then i would be ok with the situation. Do yourself a favor and use another platform like Gemini or binance.","Garbage! Constantly freezing, especially when switching between apps. Constantly getting logged out and when I try to log back in I get a rate limit exceeded message that even by changing password I still can't log in and get same error, waited about an hour, uninstalled and still no progress. Trying to log on through web browser and it just loads and loads with the same stupid blue lines just chilling in the middle of the screen with no progress. This happens often, I regret transfer my funds","Used to be good. Now it doesn't even load past the title screen. Desktop app doesn't load at all. It's been almost a week and I can't get a reply from anybody for customer support, so I guess that's goodbye to my $2000.

But the bugs and other issues make this game literally unplayable. The goal of the game is to obtain 600 starbases. However, the more bases you obtain, the more the server gets strained, causing server disconnection. Gradually the frequence of server disconnects increases untill the game becomes unplayable. This happens at around 280 bases with about 1 disconnection EVERY MINUTE. So at that point it's basically game over and goodbye to your money if you invested any by buying the ingame currency. Have a great day now and go play something else :) Kind Regards, Ellochain.","Awesome game! I think the interface and the settings menu therein could use just a little love, however, for being a mostly solo project I've got to commend you for your work it is truly a masterpiece. I've just begun college for video-game program and design I know that it is no easy feat to accomplish what you have here, so congratulations! I love it!","A lot of potential being so new. Edit: After 4 days i see this is a better game than Eve Echoes, No bots, no 1000 bugs, here you dont get 1 billion ship exploding when you log in or cross a stargate. I hated echoes for all they did to make the game as miserable asbthey could. Webview canary with hardware acceleration flags is a must have for games using webview like eve echoes or this one. Im enjoying Stellar Invictus more. (Several disconects that only reveal after 5+ minutes, clockexploits BAD","These 2 stars are to praise the fact that 1 person has created and continues to develop this app. However, in practicality, due to server stability issues, this game is more a lesson in handling frustration. Long build times, ship movement, 72 hour alliance cooldown getting reset continously all day and night is frustating and most efforts are futile. This game is nearly UNPLAYABLE at this time due to the extremely frequent and continous disconnects. Will Rate 5* if stability improves.","A great MMO game that I really enjoy playing so far. Gameplay is smooth, hardly any ads anywhere, reasonable wait times, and an excellent game to spend a but of time on every few hours or once a day. Although you need to wait a bit however, there is still always something you can still do.

Its upsetting because i have all 5 of PHTs game apps and they have excellent withdrawal limits for erc-20 tokens and alt coins.

The API key was an issue when I first downloaded months ago. Locked me out so I left it alone. Come back today. I try to track down which email/password I started with months ago since it wouldn't let me restart the process with that email and in doing so have locked myself out again. To top it off, I don't remember the API that I will undoubtedly need if I can ever get back in. I'm sure the app is fine but why so many hoops to jump?","The app that make you want to slap yo mama, kidding. I think it's a good start to be in bit there is room for improvement. The biggest things I'd like to see change in the future is not being able to conduct transactions in app, being limited to only wire transfers (and their fees) to fund the account and not listing newer alt coins. The minor change I'd like is the ability to view your investments instead entire market. Apart from the app, their customer service is top notch!","I like the layout and the easily accessible data that is available but freezes up at times forcing you to clear the app from recents and restarting. Has a tendency to just force close on you when you are either making a trade or selling or randomly asking for your password when you decide to make a transaction. Kinda annoying at times. Update: Seems to be fixed as of last update. Problem went away.","This app works GREAT when it WORKS. Can't tell you how much stress the app induced on me alone. The Website Version is ALOT more consistent, thus, would highly recommend sticking to that over the app, UNTIL it improves of course. Update: They have definitely fixed the issue:). App is TEN TIMES BETTER THAN COINBASE AND 100 TIMES BETTER THAN VOYAGER. I love the features and the fact that you can access them both on the app & PC! Must have this downloaded if your an avid crypto fanatic!","Good app. Solid features. It could do a more comprehensive job presenting market data, and it could be more \"information dense\". On an S21u I can only view 5 currencies at a time. And it only sorts alphabetically or by volume. Sorting by price change over various time periods while viewing 3-4 x more currencies at once would be really helpful for keeping track of the market relative to your holdings."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.kraken.trade","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kraken.trade&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"CoinTracking","description":"The official CoinTracking app. Simply the best way to keep accurate track of your cryptocurrency portfolio.

You pay premium price and get broken tool where you have to spend days manually fixing everything Cointracking got wrong - even from a few simple imports. It can't even reflect the correct current balance with active exchange API! The support is average at the best. You may be lucky to get someone answer simpler question almost immediately or spend weeks looking for a (simple) solution. The quality corresponds perhaps to free alpha version, NOT paid service.","I had so much hope for this app. It's professional and in depth and, frankly, mind boggling. I've tried for weeks to figure it out. I downloaded records from exchanges and tried to manually enter the rest. It's a complete MESS!😵 I have negative totals and black holes of mystery. Today I found the \"Easy Enter System!\" Why was this burried? I just want to know what I bought at, sold at, and what I have is worth, which this sys offered. BUT. Everything is in terms of BITCOINS! What?! I give up.","Functionality its solid, but It could use an improved interface, and an aesthetic overhaul to be more appealing. The desktop version is great, but the app is meh, if they improve on it I think it could be a serious contender. Most other free portfolio trackers are glitchy or have features restricted behind buy walls. I hope they continue with the free version, and find another means of monetization their effort.","Fantastic application. However, last update was on Feb 2019 is very disappointing. Statistics are still basic for this app. So much to be added to get the best understanding for your portfolio on hourly, daily and monthly basis. It's very crucial to know what affected your portfolio on an hourly basis to act fast","Paid user here. Please add a clear and concise way to find the cost basis for current holdings in each SEPARATE exchange. This is sorely missing in your app. Also, sync 1x a day is rediculous.

I have used this app to make at least 1000 trades and have not had a single issue on any one of them. I had one small issue when I purchased the ads-free version, so I emailed the developer, and within 2 hours he responded to me to let me know it had been fixed. I don't normally review apps, but there was a lot of care and pride put into this, and with such amazing customer service, it deserves it!","Ive been using the old version of this app for more than a year as my go to for mobile access to kraken trading. A+. The author makes occasional updates and upgrades whenever kraken adds a coin or the community needs a change, and it already has everything we need to trade. I actually like the positions layout better than the kraken website. Its a shame all the old ratings were lost as he probably had thousand of good reviews. They were only lost because google didnt like his old logo.","Great app. Again, my only criticism of this app is that it doesn't show values MORE PRECISELY and rounds up or down the values, making it hard for me to trade any smaller valued coin w/ XBT on the app . PLEASE add more digits (upto 8) after the decimal, so that we can make more accurate trades on the app itself.","Wonderful app, with a *fatal flaw which has caused me to lose significant money on multiple occasions - even though I know to look out for the problem - by executing a trade which I do not intend. Unfortunately the creator is unresponsive to email.* I would certainly avoid until he fixes it!","I understand that there are adds. But I hate the very loud adds that pop up at the wrong times.

Cold wallet staking provide full reward, through mycointainer you get reduced reward and on top of that you get hit with a reward fees. Eg. Cosmos self staking you get 9-10%, mycointainer 8.1% minus 0.41% reward fees. Even though provide easy staking services but dig deep into your rewards.","I started using My Container in June 2020 and I have deposited a bunch of coins on there, also subscribed to the POWER subscription. At first it did run smooth but now I do not get coins every month for the extra subscription. There are some things that I do not agree with, one is that the POWER subscription just got raised without any notice, the second one is that there is a minimum withdrawal for coins and the third is that one does not get rewards for the coins he gets on the subscription. The phone app is a bit shady and has some glitches once in a while like not showing exact amounts, or mistaking the amounts received with euro currency. My humble opinion is that it is a service that can be improved. I would like to see more details on the coins and earnings, 8 decimals as they should be. I would like to not have a minimum withdrawal and maybe get rewards for the rewarded coins one gets. Besides these things that some wouldn't consider minor, the service is a decent staking and masternode service. I do enjoy the giveaways that they have once in a while. Thank you","The app isn't too bad. It lacks all the features you'll find on the website, but it keeps up. This app is pretty much unlike most others in terms of crypto currencies. They offer you airdrops left and right and all sorts of ways to earn. There are some downsides. My KYC verification took about 20 tries. I'm not sure why, but it did eventually go through. If you are looking for an app that will reward you for staking crypto this one will do it. Just be alert that you'll need to stake ~$100 worth of whatever it is you are staking, or you won't be able to withdraw it until it hits that level. The APR earnings are just ridiculously high so it's definitely worth investing some time and effort into. I'll be using them for a a while.","Unexpectedly robust app! Walked through the app for to login and check the mobile UI. Perfect and Very tidy! But it would be more entertaining and not boring if you guys add some twist on it, some rewarding game/s, maybe spin the wheel, some scratching games, or coin prediction. As a user and money making online hunter, that is a ++ bonus. Or daily check in that rewards that makes us go check the app daily. :)"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.mycontainer","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mycontainer&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"StormX: Shop and earn or play and earn free crypto","description":"🛍️  Shop at your favorite stores and earn free Bitcoin or Ethereum.

It'll say in the rules \"within 20 days of installing\" and I'll go check on the status within 7, and the reward info isn't even available. This has happened to me twice. It doesn't even store it in my history. I'm frustrated.","Ordered some things on Aliexpress. At first, I thought it didn't work, but in a week or so the points showed up for my purchases.

I bought specifically MAYP on the 27/4/21, when the market price was 2.387857 BTC. The problem with the website, is it does not show you how much you will received before you press confirm. So I unfortunately trusted the system, and when I clicked purchase, I then received half the amount i expected. I found on my receipt that they paid out at market value 5.0 BTC. The big issues is, their customer support is comparable to a brick wall. Since this transaction, I have been in contact with their customer support via email, we have had about 25 emails back and forth, and so far every response I get is: \"Dear user, good day. Sorry for the delay. Your issue will be considered and fixed. It may take some time, but don't worry! there will be a resolution.\" It's been over a month and they haven't once mentioned anything this consequential glitch, and I don't think they will. Don't lose your money like me. And to coinsbit, please don't respond to this message saying 'please contact us' like you did last time, as I did what you said, and that has gone nowhere.

I created an account went through the tutorial and it gave 2000 acf pts. Gave me a button to click on it Said \"Register now.\" Big bright yellow box. The button said to \"COMPLETE\" my registration in order to save my progress. I clicked it and it sent me through the tutorial again. Once completed it said it was deducting my acf points for detecting fraud from opening more than 1 account and then stripped me of all the coins. Now the only way I can get more than is real $$$..What a JOK","Cool concept but poor execution. I am a crypto fan boy and I really wanna like this game but it can't keep my attention as it doesn't seem to have a flow to the game. Even with the tutorial and an understanding of crypto exchange interfaces I cannot seem to find meaningful things to do.","Updating my review. Thanks to Tom for reinstating my account. Now that I'm actually able to play, i can say this app is fun and informative. The contests are good and some are categorized and only allow those cryptos (in order for you to learn what each crypto is used for ie. Privacy coins, currency coins). For the simulation part, it is great. It has basically all the features and options a real exchange would have. The price changes are delayed though. I enjoyed the margin trading too","I've been using this app for over a year. It's good practice, it's fun and if you place well enough in the contests they ACTUALLY pay you. Also, the support team answers and solves issues you might have in a timely fashion. If I had the money I would totally pay to be a gold member, although, I feel like I should be grand-fathered in just because I've been a loyal patron for so long. Maybe they will consider???","The app is a great way to still participate on the go. One thing to improve: the buy/sell pages - it is hard to slide the amount to buy or sell when you can switch tabs by swiping. Using a slider on a swipeable tab is not easy to use if you want to for example sell all your current coins. I suggest using the same methodology of the website by adding the 25, 50, 75, 100 percentages to choose. Apart from this, app is fast and never has given me any problems."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.altcoinfantasy.altcoinfantasy","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.altcoinfantasy.altcoinfantasy&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"⭐️Bitcoin, Ethereum, IOTA Ripple Price,Crypto News","description":"Investing.com offers an overview of cryptocurrency markets, ideal for tracking prices and exchange rates.\r\n* Real-Time and historical price data tracking for a variety of digital assets\r\n* Quotes for more than 1300 altcoins and fiat currencies\r\n* Market capitalization per altcoin\r\n* Market dominance\r\n* Trading volume\r\n* Percentage change in price for 1D, 7D\r\n\r\nNEWS & ANALYSIS\r\nStay up to date with the latest Bitcoin and altcoin news and analysis from the following sources: Investing.com, CoinDesk, NewsWire, Bitcoin Magazine, The Merkle, CryptoPotato, CryptoCoins News, Blockchain.com Blog, Bitcoinist, Altcoin Today, Coin Telegraph, Yahoo, Reuters.\r\n\r\nPORTFOLIO\r\nEasily monitor all your blockchain assets and holdings, along with real-time detailed information on each coin. \r\nTrack the total profit & loss in last 24 hours. \r\nOur portfolio allows you to identify trends, changes and opportunities for trading, based on live and historical data.\r\n\r\nALERTS AND PRICE NOTIFICATIONS\r\nUse alerts to immediately get notified when the price crosses a certain threshold.

Everything tells me to download new version. Please have a look at this🙏 Star rating updated. Quick respons from support. I rebooted my phone, and it works perfectly now😉","The app looks legit, though am enjoying it, I will give five stars when I receive my payment. But the problem with the app is that the offers don't work anymore, in the first place I completed one offer, and I successfully received my coins in my dashboard, but then on the second instance I completed three offers , till today I haven't received my coins on my dashboard, pls the developer should fix this !.","I've verified my account for several times but still I couldn't login and keeps showing you account is not verified.if it is a bug pls fix it.I don't know how this app got over 4 rating with this bug. No use of clearing cached data.Still the problem exist. Refreshing screen loads the app for very long time and again showing the same thing.Edit : Finally opened and rolled up for some ltc it's paying very lower max around 120litoshis,seems like it will take months to earn the minimum withdrawal.","Not a lot of ads and I quite enjoy rolling it. Once I get my payment after reaching the threshold, I will change the star rating. Update - they pay your accumulated litoshis once your threshold is met. It is automated. Recommended","Just 5 star. Nothing to say. I have gotten my payment just today and the minimum amount is 0.00025 which took me just 2 days.

I have been using Netkoin a few months. I have cashed out several times, usually around $7.00 per 200,000 points, which is minimum washout. You can choose dogecoin, Bitcoin cash, litecoin, tron, and I think Dash is the 5th. Anyways, almost up to 200,000 again. This morning I had 132,000 which was worth $4.60. Now I have 162,000 worth $3.60. They are lowering the payouts by half, which means I'm out after the next cashout!","Liked the app and the surveys but it is a fake game in my opinion and not worth people's time, when you get to a reward amount they dont pay you you have to contact netkoin support. Yet again I am waiting for a payout that hasn't been credited to me and will be taking my complaint further.. would have give this game 0 stars but no option for that. They also accuse you of using a vpn when you are not, so they dont have to pay you.. am in process of taking further/legal action.","From my own experience and from what I read of other people, this app is a scam. Do not waste your time doing task to claim crypto after, they will never pay you. I claimed more than 400 Dogecoins since the 3rd of April and none of my claimed made it to my wallet. I tried to contact their support, they do not answer any of my email. I also try to write on Telegram on their group chat with their founder, the best I got was ''I will come back to you soon''. A week later, he doesn't answer to my messages anymore. It is really frustrating to waste your time doing tasks to finally get nothing. THIS APP IS A SCAM UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.","The app works very well and I love the design of it. The wallets I haven't personally used but I've heard work fine for most. I think the minimum amount of netkoin you need to withdraw is a bit high. (200,000 netkoin or 7-8$) For me getting the actually currency took a bit of work. I waited 48+ hours and never got the currency. I ended up having to contact them but they were very helpful and they got in contact within 6 hours. Ended up resolving it and got the currency. Customer Support A+","Have used Netkoin for a couple of months.. overall look & use of the app is simple & straightforward.. was able to claim NTK for doge.. this took approximately 3 days for this transaction to be received & confirmed in my wallet.. recently, I claimed NTK for ltc.. after 7 days & not receiving the ltc, I sent an email to support.. currently waiting on a response.. will update review depending on outcome.. *UPDATE.. Received an email from support & the ltc within 24 hours.. adding 1 more star.."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.netkoin.app","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netkoin.app&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Coinmotion","description":"We’re one of the leading cryptocurrency service providers in Europe with users in over 20 countries in Europe.

I went ahead and bought the lifetime subscription, app paid for itself in the first week.","Right now I can't use this app as they dont offer certain exchanges I use such as Uphold, OKCoin, and Bitrue. If they offer API portfolio tracking of these exchanges in the future I will change my review to 5 stars as I will be using it rather than the multiple apps I currently have to use. This app has so much potential, keep up the good work guys. I will be checking back regularly to find out if you have added these exchanges!","Great app, logo is cheesy but don't let it fool you. Best overall app on for crypto. 4 stars because it's expensive and a yearly subscription for upgraded features","Great app, integrate nearly any exchange you can possibly think of with full functionality from API's. My only suggestion would be to get more wallet functionality ASAP! Then, once all listed wallets have been enabled, let the GC Community suggest and/or vote on which wallets and exchanges get implemented next. P. S.

You pay premium price and get broken tool where you have to spend days manually fixing everything Cointracking got wrong - even from a few simple imports. It can't even reflect the correct current balance with active exchange API! The support is average at the best. You may be lucky to get someone answer simpler question almost immediately or spend weeks looking for a (simple) solution. The quality corresponds perhaps to free alpha version, NOT paid service.","I had so much hope for this app. It's professional and in depth and, frankly, mind boggling. I've tried for weeks to figure it out. I downloaded records from exchanges and tried to manually enter the rest. It's a complete MESS!😵 I have negative totals and black holes of mystery. Today I found the \"Easy Enter System!\" Why was this burried? I just want to know what I bought at, sold at, and what I have is worth, which this sys offered. BUT. Everything is in terms of BITCOINS! What?! I give up.","Functionality its solid, but It could use an improved interface, and an aesthetic overhaul to be more appealing. The desktop version is great, but the app is meh, if they improve on it I think it could be a serious contender. Most other free portfolio trackers are glitchy or have features restricted behind buy walls. I hope they continue with the free version, and find another means of monetization their effort.","Fantastic application. However, last update was on Feb 2019 is very disappointing. Statistics are still basic for this app. So much to be added to get the best understanding for your portfolio on hourly, daily and monthly basis. It's very crucial to know what affected your portfolio on an hourly basis to act fast","Paid user here. Please add a clear and concise way to find the cost basis for current holdings in each SEPARATE exchange. This is sorely missing in your app. Also, sync 1x a day is rediculous.

No other app is as thorough. However, crypto is impossible to track accurately when u are using DeFi, staking, conversions or simply pay ex fees. So don't have high hopes that you'll be sorted out 100%. My only criticism of the app is some major cap coins are not supported. Check their website to get an idea. If u can afford it, it's worth it. I can't, but fun during trial","Usable to a decent degree. Connected and displays my wallets with easy setup, interface is pretty clean and intuitive. My biggest gripe is my coinbase trades not aligning with the prices cointracker monitors, so every trade is marginally off but eventually adds up. I couldn't confidently DCA with their provided figures since my portfolio simply doesn't reflect my accurate purchases. I chaulk up all this data as \"ballparking\" to dig into my personal/manual tracker to set up some juicy trades.","Free version should a least let you show performance for the current day. Also, the subscription package is too expensive. Update: there is nothing on the top right corner. There are buttons below the chart, and the 1D one, which is almost unselectable because it falls outside the screen, says that I need a subscription to see the data.","Great place to be able to view my entire portfolio from multiple exchanges/wallets. Better as a big picture thing, as it doesn't keep super accurate prices up to the minute. Looks like it'll awesome for taxes.

Cosmos self staking you get 9-10%, mycointainer 8.1% minus 0.41% reward fees. Even though provide easy staking services but dig deep into your rewards.","I started using My Container in June 2020 and I have deposited a bunch of coins on there, also subscribed to the POWER subscription. At first it did run smooth but now I do not get coins every month for the extra subscription. There are some things that I do not agree with, one is that the POWER subscription just got raised without any notice, the second one is that there is a minimum withdrawal for coins and the third is that one does not get rewards for the coins he gets on the subscription. The phone app is a bit shady and has some glitches once in a while like not showing exact amounts, or mistaking the amounts received with euro currency. My humble opinion is that it is a service that can be improved. I would like to see more details on the coins and earnings, 8 decimals as they should be. I would like to not have a minimum withdrawal and maybe get rewards for the rewarded coins one gets. Besides these things that some wouldn't consider minor, the service is a decent staking and masternode service. I do enjoy the giveaways that they have once in a while. Thank you","The app isn't too bad. It lacks all the features you'll find on the website, but it keeps up. This app is pretty much unlike most others in terms of crypto currencies. They offer you airdrops left and right and all sorts of ways to earn. There are some downsides. My KYC verification took about 20 tries. I'm not sure why, but it did eventually go through. If you are looking for an app that will reward you for staking crypto this one will do it. Just be alert that you'll need to stake ~$100 worth of whatever it is you are staking, or you won't be able to withdraw it until it hits that level. The APR earnings are just ridiculously high so it's definitely worth investing some time and effort into. I'll be using them for a a while.","Unexpectedly robust app! Walked through the app for to login and check the mobile UI. Perfect and Very tidy!

The app is atrocious for shopping/browsing stores through the app. Can't get logged into some stores, can't navigate on others.

It'll say in the rules \"within 20 days of installing\" and I'll go check on the status within 7, and the reward info isn't even available. This has happened to me twice. It doesn't even store it in my history. I'm frustrated.","Ordered some things on Aliexpress. At first, I thought it didn't work, but in a week or so the points showed up for my purchases.

Estaba dispuesto a dejar de usar mi tarjeta de debito y cambiarme a Tauros, pero las tarjetas físicas llevan agotadas desde que bajé la app, además cuesta $300 (???). Mi queja numero uno: las comisiones de retiro de cripto, específicamente las de BCH, LTC y XLM. Vaya scam cobrar 0.5 XLM por transacción cuando hay una TARIFA FIJA en la red de Stellar de 0.00001 XLM. Hasta que no dejen de vernos la cara con eso no planeo usar Tauros en mi día a día.","Excelente exchange para comprar BTC, ETH y otras criptos.

I created an account went through the tutorial and it gave 2000 acf pts. Gave me a button to click on it Said \"Register now.\" Big bright yellow box. The button said to \"COMPLETE\" my registration in order to save my progress. I clicked it and it sent me through the tutorial again. Once completed it said it was deducting my acf points for detecting fraud from opening more than 1 account and then stripped me of all the coins. Now the only way I can get more than is real $$$..What a JOK","Cool concept but poor execution. I am a crypto fan boy and I really wanna like this game but it can't keep my attention as it doesn't seem to have a flow to the game. Even with the tutorial and an understanding of crypto exchange interfaces I cannot seem to find meaningful things to do.","Updating my review. Thanks to Tom for reinstating my account. Now that I'm actually able to play, i can say this app is fun and informative. The contests are good and some are categorized and only allow those cryptos (in order for you to learn what each crypto is used for ie. Privacy coins, currency coins). For the simulation part, it is great. It has basically all the features and options a real exchange would have. The price changes are delayed though. I enjoyed the margin trading too","I've been using this app for over a year. It's good practice, it's fun and if you place well enough in the contests they ACTUALLY pay you. Also, the support team answers and solves issues you might have in a timely fashion. If I had the money I would totally pay to be a gold member, although, I feel like I should be grand-fathered in just because I've been a loyal patron for so long. Maybe they will consider???","The app is a great way to still participate on the go. One thing to improve: the buy/sell pages - it is hard to slide the amount to buy or sell when you can switch tabs by swiping. Using a slider on a swipeable tab is not easy to use if you want to for example sell all your current coins. I suggest using the same methodology of the website by adding the 25, 50, 75, 100 percentages to choose. Apart from this, app is fast and never has given me any problems."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.altcoinfantasy.altcoinfantasy","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.altcoinfantasy.altcoinfantasy&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Electroneum","description":"ETN is a leading mobile cryptocurrency.\r\n\r\nDownload the ETN App to access your ETN Online Wallet, pay friends, family or businesses.

I bought specifically MAYP on the 27/4/21, when the market price was 2.387857 BTC. The problem with the website, is it does not show you how much you will received before you press confirm. So I unfortunately trusted the system, and when I clicked purchase, I then received half the amount i expected. I found on my receipt that they paid out at market value 5.0 BTC. The big issues is, their customer support is comparable to a brick wall. Since this transaction, I have been in contact with their customer support via email, we have had about 25 emails back and forth, and so far every response I get is: \"Dear user, good day. Sorry for the delay. Your issue will be considered and fixed. It may take some time, but don't worry! there will be a resolution.\" It's been over a month and they haven't once mentioned anything this consequential glitch, and I don't think they will.

You have to get verified and it can take up to 10 days however it stated you can request to send it through the platform to speed it up. Within that timline you'd have to wait to cash out which can take up to 5 business days.

Will update if fixed. Email many times, messaged from the dashboard on website and put in multiple requests for missing Satoshi and not fixed. They keep taking the Satoshi that their customers accumulate on their app. You build up 10,000 plus sat on any or multiple tabs on the app one day it's gone.

Even when you manually force update a coin price, you would see the gain/loss percent change but not the actual price. Kinda defeats the entire purpose unless you just wanted a general idea of how the currency is doing. 2) I couldn't figure out how to add more than one coin tracker. Looks like you should be able to, yet there was no \"add\" button. I decided to go with another app.","This app is great, I own a bunch of different crypto coins from several apps this gives me customizable widgets that let me track the value of my coins without having to open each exchange. My only issue with it is sometimes the connection fails and I'm not able to track for a bit. It does lag behind a bit, but as I'm not day trading this isn't a problem for me.","Exactly the widget I wanted, but I'd like to see some updates. It would be nice if I could add a label to each coin. I hold crypto for various family members and would like to label each widget with their names. Also it would be nice to see the actual price of the coin rather than the cash value of my coins.","Very nice. The refresh isn't working. I had a little crashing problem when I lost internet. Next to that, it's a very cool widget option.","Would be a 5 star if I could add more than a billion coins. I can't add my billions to this widget, cool layout though and idea.

Am not happy at all this is not encouraging do something about it","It is a good free way to continuously get small amounts of Litecoin. I use the BCH app too & they r just alike, which isnt a bad thing. One improvement that could be made is in the Playwall offers...they pay good at the very first and then make u play more for less, which is backwards and make me delete games i actually liked in place for what will give more Litoshis. That could be improved...and a lot of the surveys could be too bc there's never any available and i rarely get to finish any .","App works ok but rewards are very poor and need a huge increase, 300 thousand litoshi is worth £0.30 (30 UK pennies) a 30 second add reward can earn you 100 litoshi, 15-20min surveys reward 2p and many of the surveys disqualify you or close when you're 98% complete so you get zero rewards many times. Bitlabs surveys lie and pay out 25% what they advertise at times","You won't make a ton of money but it is consistent . They also do double days. Compared to others I like how it is an actually unit. 4/8 I completed an offer but did not get anything. There are no answers Update 4/26 Playwall offer no longer works Update 5/4 I did get a response. I appreciate. I'm banned too for some reason, even though I used Google play. The developers don't control who is banned. It's the serves they use. Oh well","I've been having problems accessing the playtime offerwall since the last update. Nothing happen when i click on the link of the playtime offerwall. Have emailed the developer but no response. It used to be okay until the latest update.

Withdrawals work with reasonable fees. You have to deposit tron to make tron. The animals and crops you pay for are very good earners and you can sell them at any time on the exchange. The economy is very real in this one and profitable as its becoming more popular. I would get in and invest into the animals before they sky rocket in price. I've been playing for 3 weeks and most animals have went up 100-200% in that time. Cropbytes has a very promising future.","I don't recommend this blockchain game. The ROI takes lots of money before you earn in the game. I bought a large starter pack but still earning little amount of game coins per day. Worst than that you need to use your TRX to buy foods for the animals making it harder to accumulate TRX. This game will not progress if they continue this kind of mechanics.","I like the game, if only they make the goods cheaper in the market it will make other players to survive. And the videos its not detailed. Thats why this game been in the market for awhile and its so slow to peak up.
