Very timely for the most part, and when seemingly backlogged they are very patient with understandibly nervous customers, and work hard to get things right.

One improvement I suggest is to improve the user experience with syncing, since it takes a long time. If you could show progress more closely instead of updating only every few hundred blocks that would be good. Or adding an estimated time until completion might also be good.","Used to work fine on my Android phone. But XMR won't sync anymore or connect to any nodes, all show red.

Whoever holds your wallet's secret key words holds control of the wallet's money. So, you can access your money from anywhere in the world, and send it to anyone. Every single Monero transaction is protected by layer upon layer of peer-reviewed, privacy-enforcing cryptography. Virtually all other attempts at digital currencies besides Monero publicly expose how much money you have and who you are transacting with. This leads to a genuine safety issue that Monero solves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n‚Ä¢ MyMonero: a light-weight wallet for Monero\r\n\r\n\r\nMonero users often choose to run their own Monero server. When they want to view their wallet balance on a new device, they have had to spend days downloading the Monero blockchain (gigabytes) and then had their mobile scan every part of it for their own transactions. Moving to a new device meant losing their outgoing transactions history because it's not stored on the Monero blockchain.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith MyMonero, you get instant access to your wallet and history from any device, without having to scan the blockchain. But there's no trade-off of control because MyMonero's lightwallet technology builds Monero transactions directly on your device, so that your wallet secret key words and \"spend key\" never leave your device. So we couldn't spend your money even if we wanted to. The only thing that is sent to a MyMonero-compatible server is the \"view key\". (Don't want to use the MyMonero server? Just set a compatible server in Preferences.)\r\n\r\n\r\nWe don't add any fees on top of the normal Monero network fee to send money, receiving is free, and adding new wallets is completely free. MyMonero supports multiple wallets at a time, so you can go nuts and keep an account for savings and an account for spending cash.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n‚Ä¢ Design-First\r\n\r\n\r\nMyMonero is feature-packed, and designed to support zippy in-person transactions. Need to send your buddy some Monero? Have them create a new Request QR code. Simply scan it with your phone and hit Send!\r\n\r\n\r\nTired of keeping track of all your friends' 95-character Monero addresses? MyMonero comes with built-in smart contacts support. And if your contacts have support on their personal websites for OpenAlias, you can just enter their email or domain and the app will automatically look up their Monero address.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll of your secret data, including your contacts and requests, is kept directly on your device under industry-standard AES-256 symmetric-key encryption. Only *you* know your encryption password. The app locks itself whenever you step away, ensuring no one can gain access to your secret keys.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe all still use world currencies like USD in daily life, so MyMonero comes with built-in currency countervalue support. Create requests in the currency of your choice. The sender's app will calculate the Monero amount to send at the time they scan your request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n‚Ä¢ Open Source\r\n\r\n\r\nThe MyMonero project is completely open-source and has had many components of its design reviewed by the broader Monero community. We were founded by a Monero core team member in 2014 and are owned and operated by Monero contributors.\r\n\r\n\r\nBe your own bank with MyMonero. Your money and your privacy are yours.

Dapp browser conflicts with Android Web View sometimes causing loading of exchanges to slow down immensely. Support for ease of access to exchanges is incredible and top quality. In App Price chart is slow to reflect real-time value and tends to lag behind the real time value of coins 9/10 times. In App buy minimum to fund the wallet is painfully high most times. Suggest sending funds to wallet from elsewhere","So far My experience using the trust wallet app has been very good I must admit.... BUT, BUT, BUT your continuous habit of deleting users transaction history/ID everytime the app is updated is a big FAILURE , y'all really need to find a solution to this issue... There isn't any backup feature which allows TX history/ID to be saved & this can be a big issue for many users from different parts of the globe.... As a early user of TW having access to my TX history/ID is very important .... Pls Fix","I was initially a little upset with Trust Wallet because of some issues I was having, but they have great customer service! Now that I know how to fully use the app, it is very easy and I like it. Edit: I lowered my review to 3 stars. I have used a lot of crypto apps and this is definitely the most difficult one to use. I also have lost a lot of crypto while sending it through them."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.wallet.crypto.trustapp","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wallet.crypto.trustapp&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"stakmon","description":"An easy to use app designed to monitor your xmr-stak powered mining rigs.

Maybe they are just 'busy' but it's been two weeks since I submitted my ticket and I still haven't conversed with a human! Ergo, one star because the app installs. Nothing more as my BTC are still yet to be found since I 'smart' transferred them in. I would avoid this app at the present time based solely on the support experience. [edit] Support ticket#333616 has been responded to - thank you - +1 more star. [edit#2] - you mention refund but the ticket says the partner has all the info and to create a new PAYIN BTC. All very confusing. We will see. [edit#3]. They eventually refunded me, however based on this experience I still cannot recommend nor give > 2 stars - especially when they ask me to edit the review. If I had enough funds I would transfer what little BTC I have elsewhere and close the account.","For the most part I like the app alot. I transferred in out and exchanged numerous times with no problems. It's always worked smoothly before.....I sent 14.9 xrp \"with the correct tag number included\" ......and never recieved the xrp. I submitted a ticket. Waited. Then got an email saying they are backed up on tickets and are trashing all existing open tickets and to submit a new one. I did. It's been a week since I submitted the new one. Costumer Service at freewallet is a joke.","ticket ID is 315537 Update: The customer service officially provided me the things i needed to submit.

And why? I've never seen another app exchange ever have these issues. The date and time that was requested for payout or exchange should be honored. It was offered to the users as functional, and hasn't been the case on your end as promised.. These excuses are not acceptable. Compensation seems appropriate for start.","Apparently, the WORST app ever. Been trying to sign up since forever. I've re-installed the app severally.

And why we have 2 apps, normal and pro. Just integrate both in one app and user should be able to choose the normal or pro layout just like other exchange.

Half a year later, I feel a need to update this review but unfortunately I can't give more than 5 stars. In the beginning I screwed up two times with my fiat fundings. I thought I lost that money, but when I reached out to Kraken support they fixed it in less than two days. Very friendly and patient employees üíé‚ú®üëë","One thing I really miss is a little indicator next to my coins that shows the change in their value as a percentage compared to my initial investment (ex. +3,6% compared to when I bought the coin). Honestly, I don't understand how is this not a feature already, literally every other crypto and stock exchange has this. Otherwise it's great so far.","I'm genuinely shocked at how basic this app is. It's meant to be one of the most established exchanges, but the functionality of this app is way behind any others I've used. There's no ability to search, and cryptos aren't listed alphabetically, so it's difficult to find anything. No price alerts either. I can only assume a browser based version is far better.","This app requires me to remove and register my bank constantly. Advice from support was to just keep reconnecting it. But I am limited to 5 bank connects within a 30 day period. Great advice... üòë. Something todo with a timeout from my bank. Well, yeah you don't keep the connection open unless you are buying. If it's trustly's error then switch to plaid Gemini works just fine, no issues whats so ever. If Gemini added Cardano to their platform.

Even when you manually force update a coin price, you would see the gain/loss percent change but not the actual price. Kinda defeats the entire purpose unless you just wanted a general idea of how the currency is doing. 2) I couldn't figure out how to add more than one coin tracker. Looks like you should be able to, yet there was no \"add\" button. I decided to go with another app.","This app is great, I own a bunch of different crypto coins from several apps this gives me customizable widgets that let me track the value of my coins without having to open each exchange. My only issue with it is sometimes the connection fails and I'm not able to track for a bit. It does lag behind a bit, but as I'm not day trading this isn't a problem for me.","Exactly the widget I wanted, but I'd like to see some updates. It would be nice if I could add a label to each coin. I hold crypto for various family members and would like to label each widget with their names. Also it would be nice to see the actual price of the coin rather than the cash value of my coins.","Very nice. The refresh isn't working. I had a little crashing problem when I lost internet. Next to that, it's a very cool widget option.","Would be a 5 star if I could add more than a billion coins. I can't add my billions to this widget, cool layout though and idea.

My transaction failed, and I still ain't receive my money back. I even wrote a return address. I sent several emails, (their number doesn't even work). I have a feeling this app is making profits by keeping the failed transactions. Well the issue was solved. Thank You Change Now. This is a great app, but your customer service department needs more improvement. I understand though that it's a new system in place. It takes a team!","This app saved me so much trouble. The transfer to and from my coinbase wallet was fast and painless. Once I transferred my side of the swap I received my crypto into my wallet within 2 minutes. If you're in the US in a state seems to be attempting to limit your access to certain instruments like XRP, this app is a really solid tool. Don't blame the app if you send your funds off into thin air lol. It's your own fault if you copy and paste your wallet links incorrectly. It's also hilarious.","Had an issue with a withdrawal from an exchange on my end (3 days after initiated swap it finally cleared ) and I guess by the time it did send ChangeNOW's system didnt pick it up. Within 2 hours after contacting support with verifiable information, all funds (and some) were distributed to the receiving address. Great and responsive support staff, a true diamond in the rough in this industry","Horrible app. I have been waiting for forever for exchange to complete and when it did half of my money was gone!. The fees are too high. I will just count the $60 gone AVOID AT ALL COST...because it will cost you","seems like high fees but exchange and all network transaction fees included... So what you see is what you get. No hidden fees... Two trades so far, both were completed in less than 15 minutes.

Beware.","Simple, clean, and source available. Beware, though. They claim only the minimum blockchain fees are assessed but the build distributed here charges multiple doge, sometimes tens or even hundreds, when Dogecoin famously only requires 1 doge for even large transactions. Where are these extra doge going? Are they going somewhere or are users simply forced to overpay? No option to edit fee. Strangely, it seems honest and correct for other coins. I use the langerhans wallet for Dogecoin anyway but it's frustrating because I'd like to recommend this one for general multi-coin use.","Says it converts DOGE, then doesn't let you. Transferred crypto over to it and now wasted a fee to do that and going to get charged for going somewhere else. This is a waste of your time, find another app, another site, anywhere that you can that will let you convert what you want to. Seems pretty dodgy to advertise something and then not do anything that you've said. The app is easy enough to use, and that's the only reason for not giving a 1, simple and basic, nothing to say there, but definitely not worth your time for trading.","Great app just having trouble getting a old account back as I don't know of the log in","Charged me a $10 fee for buying $30 of Bitcoin, then only alaws me to send half of what I put in.

I email the problem to customer service and it takes them 3 months to get back to me with the exact same instructions. NOW I HAVE 4 WALLETS WITH O BALANCE!! My money is in my original which I still can't get them to give me any way to access it. Bottom line ...don't trust them with your money! I have talked to others that have the same problem. Don't trust Abra!","Nothing special about its features. The interest earning options require a KYC application with Prime Trust. My application was pending for over 2 months with no explanation. My repeated attempts to get more information resulted in automated, bot generated emails, and no action. ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE customer service!!! At least I was able to take my BTC out.","They are saying that it's wallet has it's own unique recovery phrase, but when I login in my recovery phrase I can't recover my account anymore, my investment was gone. I did my verification of identity but it stuck me, there's no way to proceed. hoping they will improve their system. I've lost my 300 Canadian dollars. it was.","Why does it all me to update my app all the time when there is no update available? They claim no fees but they get you on the spread. Comes out close to what Coinbase charges, only CB is transparent about it. I've had the app for 3 days but got a message today saying I had to update it to use it. So I go to update it. There's no update available. You can't do limit orders.","Multiple attempts over the past four months to verify KYC proved futile, even when app confirms successful completion of verification process. All requests for assistance through Abra's customer service yield no results in rectifying the issue. Not only does it take customer service, in average, three weeks to respond to inquiries, but their response is always the same; to follow the app step by step guide to complete KYC verification."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.plutus.wallet","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.plutus.wallet&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Bitcoin Price & Widget, Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin","description":"Stay informed about the Bitcoin (btc), Litecoin (ltc), Dash (dsh), Bitcoin Cash (bch), IOTA (iot), Decred (dcr), Monero (xmr), Ripple (xrp), ZCash (zec) and Ethereum (eth) prices with real time informations, exclusive charts (1d/1w/1m), price alerts and widget.\r\nCreate customized alerts and use our exclusive ticker and simple widget to monitor de market.\r\nGet the latest news and monitor market from anywhere!\r\n\r\nSupported exchanges:\r\n\r\n‚Ä¢ Coinbase (US)\r\n‚Ä¢ 3Xbit (BR)\r\n‚Ä¢ FoxBit (BR)\r\n‚Ä¢ MercadoBitcoin (BR)\r\n‚Ä¢ Bitcointoyou (B2U) (BR)\r\n‚Ä¢ BitcoinTrade\r\n‚Ä¢ Bittrex\r\n‚Ä¢ Binance (CH)\r\n‚Ä¢ Bitfinex\r\n‚Ä¢ Poloniex\r\n‚Ä¢ Walltime\r\n‚Ä¢ BtcChina (CN)\r\n‚Ä¢ Bter (US)\r\n‚Ä¢ Bitstamp\r\n‚Ä¢ Braziliex\r\n‚Ä¢ Huobi\r\n‚Ä¢ OkCoin\r\n‚Ä¢ Cex.IO\r\n‚Ä¢ Kraken\r\n‚Ä¢ Korbit\r\n‚Ä¢ Bitflyer\r\n‚Ä¢ Bitc√¢mbio\r\n‚Ä¢ FlowBTC\r\n‚Ä¢ NegocieCoins\r\n\r\nNews providers:\r\n\r\n‚Ä¢ NewsBTC.com\r\n‚Ä¢ Bitcoin.cpm\r\n‚Ä¢ BitcoinMagazine.com\r\n‚Ä¢ Cointelegraph.com\r\n‚Ä¢ Portaldobitcoin.com\r\n‚Ä¢ Guiadobitcoin.com.br\r\n‚Ä¢ BestBitcoin.com.br\r\n‚Ä¢ BitcoinNews.com.br","descriptionHTML":"Stay informed about the Bitcoin (btc), Litecoin (ltc), Dash (dsh), Bitcoin Cash (bch), IOTA (iot), Decred (dcr), Monero (xmr), Ripple (xrp), ZCash (zec) and Ethereum (eth) prices with real time informations, exclusive charts (1d/1w/1m), price alerts and widget.<br>Create customized alerts and use our exclusive ticker and simple widget to monitor de market.<br>Get the latest news and monitor market from anywhere!<br><br>Supported exchanges:<br><br>‚Ä¢ Coinbase (US)<br>‚Ä¢ 3Xbit (BR)<br>‚Ä¢ FoxBit (BR)<br>‚Ä¢ MercadoBitcoin (BR)<br>‚Ä¢ Bitcointoyou (B2U) (BR)<br>‚Ä¢ BitcoinTrade<br>‚Ä¢ Bittrex<br>‚Ä¢ Binance (CH)<br>‚Ä¢ Bitfinex<br>‚Ä¢ Poloniex<br>‚Ä¢ Walltime<br>‚Ä¢ BtcChina (CN)<br>‚Ä¢ Bter (US)<br>‚Ä¢ Bitstamp<br>‚Ä¢ Braziliex<br>‚Ä¢ Huobi<br>‚Ä¢ OkCoin<br>‚Ä¢ Cex.IO<br>‚Ä¢ Kraken<br>‚Ä¢ Korbit<br>‚Ä¢ Bitflyer<br>‚Ä¢ Bitc√¢mbio<br>‚Ä¢ FlowBTC<br>‚Ä¢ NegocieCoins<br><br>News providers:<br><br>‚Ä¢ NewsBTC.com<br>‚Ä¢ Bitcoin.cpm<br>‚Ä¢ BitcoinMagazine.com<br>‚Ä¢ Cointelegraph.com<br>‚Ä¢ Portaldobitcoin.com<br>‚Ä¢ Guiadobitcoin.com.br<br>‚Ä¢ BestBitcoin.com.br<br>‚Ä¢ BitcoinNews.com.br","summary":"Crypto price ticker, news, alerts and charts for cryptocurrencies and exchanges","installs":"100,000+","minInstalls":100000,"maxInstalls":210354,"score":4.5510206,"scoreText":"4.6","ratings":3416,"reviews":1776,"histogram":{"1":199,"2":59,"3":139,"4":278,"5":2738},"price":0,"free":true,"currency":"USD","priceText":"Free","offersIAP":false,"size":"4.6M","androidVersion":"4.1","androidVersionText":"4.1 and up","developer":"Renato Peterman","developerId":"Renato+Peterman","developerEmail":"renato.pet@gmail.com","developerWebsite":"http://www.renatopeterman.com.br","developerAddress":"Av S√£o Paulo, 3133 - Vila Bosque\nMaring√°, PR - Brasil\nCEP 87005-040","privacyPolicy":"http://www.renatopeterman.com.br/biticker/privacy_policy.html","developerInternalID":"5756275931261700196","genre":"Finance","genreId":"FINANCE","icon":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/HwgYtADPgUJ_3dfBtZfatkw75dWjy1FaXBDRIxnP9E0XfyT5gZT2yM6Gk_0PTzjTdQM","headerImage":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/erOzIKywWYE6pxLbP_ejyNAVOHZOySa48XK3VDV6anVeldqhkesV9v8OAU6hbsVwminT","screenshots":["https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/dj7xzKjuRvL929WSIpc1Zp1H9ZGbrYST4xrES7nPBBsrhWg-_h3EQERP6tXXCIf94LI","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/KjD6UFMXlM8mUWEwoORNnAVaDEFb_p3XNr05fabWvOkiI0L464GIq3uxpFP71aOfVG4","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/I8RjQ333SkRIXdtYDLjwIFsdBZMheyI59lVDiQbyAZLwUZGsmAht_OFULECcRCAF84vi","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/eP0jARBMtPvoqGwC8PEWtK9WSj22n57FV4PX164PeKe-yLDWU5hlMWq0SgpaWOv411Bo","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/DKfw63Vq5PFOv6VJA5QgfFzoL2x5YFtjuNMynIMMypG1QUSfeQ9kv7dHK2ALVsyjHw","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/vpVK-6ZZOPJw_oMaXykRJ4sCzhdiYF3gjzY3oe-bwZzL61J4vxhlwOPW0RxmbNDIKV8"],"contentRating":"Everyone","adSupported":true,"released":"Jul 11, 2015","updated":1612386252000,"version":"1.10.13","recentChanges":"Performance improvements and bugfixes.","comments":["I just downloaded the app, but the great thing about this app is one feature that is on beta right now that allows you to create an alert based on the percentage variation in the last 24hrs, which is the difference between the other apps.

Trading, buying, or transferring needs to be made more simple .","Overall the app is nice, that is if you get to open it! I've been using it for 6m now and would like to see faster replies from the customer service agents and limit orders when buying coins. Ah, I didn't get my referral credit too.

The API key was an issue when I first downloaded months ago. Locked me out so I left it alone. Come back today. I try to track down which email/password I started with months ago since it wouldn't let me restart the process with that email and in doing so have locked myself out again. To top it off, I don't remember the API that I will undoubtedly need if I can ever get back in. I'm sure the app is fine but why so many hoops to jump?","The app that make you want to slap yo mama, kidding. I think it's a good start to be in bit there is room for improvement. The biggest things I'd like to see change in the future is not being able to conduct transactions in app, being limited to only wire transfers (and their fees) to fund the account and not listing newer alt coins. The minor change I'd like is the ability to view your investments instead entire market. Apart from the app, their customer service is top notch!","I like the layout and the easily accessible data that is available but freezes up at times forcing you to clear the app from recents and restarting. Has a tendency to just force close on you when you are either making a trade or selling or randomly asking for your password when you decide to make a transaction. Kinda annoying at times. Update: Seems to be fixed as of last update. Problem went away.","This app works GREAT when it WORKS. Can't tell you how much stress the app induced on me alone. The Website Version is ALOT more consistent, thus, would highly recommend sticking to that over the app, UNTIL it improves of course. Update: They have definitely fixed the issue:). App is TEN TIMES BETTER THAN COINBASE AND 100 TIMES BETTER THAN VOYAGER. I love the features and the fact that you can access them both on the app & PC! Must have this downloaded if your an avid crypto fanatic!","Good app. Solid features. It could do a more comprehensive job presenting market data, and it could be more \"information dense\". On an S21u I can only view 5 currencies at a time. And it only sorts alphabetically or by volume.

Please do not use this!!","Worst crypto app. Trying for a month and half to restore my 2-FA due to device loss and still no answer from support.

The minor change I'd like is the ability to view your investments instead entire market. Apart from the app, their customer service is top notch!","I like the layout and the easily accessible data that is available but freezes up at times forcing you to clear the app from recents and restarting.

I would give it 5 stars but the graph data is almost always wrong. Sometimes it's off just a bit and other times it's off a lot. Like today, graphs shown next to each coin show a sharp, temporary dip but when you go into that coin to view the graph, it does not show that dip.","This app couldn't be better. One thing that I love about this app is that it doesn't require you to log in or sign up as I'm using it only to check the prices of some coins that I have purchased from a different app. The widget is lovely and the numbers are clear and I love its ability to give notifications once a coin reaches a certain amount. Removing the ads is worth your two dollars. All in all, PERFECT! üëè","This is the best functionality of all the ones I've tried, however, it is a bit buggy. Sometimes the coins on the widget disappear and you have to hit refresh. Not a big deal but it does happen. Also, sometimes when I click on a coin in the widget and it opens in the app, it opens to the last thing I was looking at and not that coin. I'd be happy to work with support.","Everything is great, I also bought the ad free pro version. Just one BIG downside in widget, I'm not able to find any option for auto refresh (pro versions in few crypto apps do offer a feature where widget prices refresh automatically within the time interval you select). I know it can affect battery life, but i hope you can offer an upgrade with that feature with user having a choice to keep it off, or select auto refresh intervals like 2, 5, 10 mins, etc. Else it was 5 star for me","Ads are too frequent unless you pay. I had to edit as the developers think we are slow and don't understand the obvious.

And why we have 2 apps, normal and pro. Just integrate both in one app and user should be able to choose the normal or pro layout just like other exchange. To be fair, sell/buy/withdrawal was a breeze experience though.","Clean User interface and very friendly experience üéâ Makes investing as simple as it should be. Half a year later, I feel a need to update this review but unfortunately I can't give more than 5 stars. In the beginning I screwed up two times with my fiat fundings. I thought I lost that money, but when I reached out to Kraken support they fixed it in less than two days. Very friendly and patient employees üíé‚ú®üëë","One thing I really miss is a little indicator next to my coins that shows the change in their value as a percentage compared to my initial investment (ex. +3,6% compared to when I bought the coin). Honestly, I don't understand how is this not a feature already, literally every other crypto and stock exchange has this. Otherwise it's great so far.","I'm genuinely shocked at how basic this app is. It's meant to be one of the most established exchanges, but the functionality of this app is way behind any others I've used. There's no ability to search, and cryptos aren't listed alphabetically, so it's difficult to find anything. No price alerts either. I can only assume a browser based version is far better.","This app requires me to remove and register my bank constantly. Advice from support was to just keep reconnecting it. But I am limited to 5 bank connects within a 30 day period. Great advice... üòë. Something todo with a timeout from my bank. Well, yeah you don't keep the connection open unless you are buying. If it's trustly's error then switch to plaid Gemini works just fine, no issues whats so ever. If Gemini added Cardano to their platform.

They don't warn you that the staking pool you choose will have several days in a row in which it will generate 0 rewards. Overall all, coin might be good, but I suggested using a different wallet, that's more user friendly, less bugs and has a timelier customer service reply.","It was a great app as wallet, especially with the last updates adding more cryptocurrencies. I faced one inconvenience after last 2 or 3 updates, I can no longer stake or claim from Earn page, telling me that is insufficient EGLD available for network fee.

This scam app is easy to recieve the cripto, but very hard to get It back or make any payments over it due to the hidden minimum amount which you can see only before the last step and which is way more then the purchase amount.

To convert your coins you must have ¬£50-¬£60 worth them which is absurd. To transfer coins the fees extortionate. They say there is no hidden fees etc and its Tx fees but you can send crypto from wallets like Coinbase, Nash & Blockchain without fees that high. I'd recommend any new users to fully avoid CoinPayments unless you want a large %of your crypto gone","I can't access acct. There is no option other then scan qr. This is a joke. .36 short and I'm being strong armed $5 in \"fees\" to make up the amount needed bc btc price went up. So not fair. You guys have it setup so no support is available.

Though if you have any sort of problem then it doesn't get addressed. Customer support is very poor and only reachable by email. It takes ages to get a response and most of the time it will not be a helpful one. Since this app deals with money it takes a huge hit because of customer care as there can't be any trust if you don't get clarification or resolution for your problems.","Good for nothing. Very very slow.. Very less users which means you end up in loss either buying or selling as there are few takers. They just hoard your funds. Can't withdraw. The process to contact customer care is a serious pain. Using this app is just a punishment for crypto lovers. Worst part is order placing. If you use your 100% funds to buy or sell. It tells you insufficient funds and by the time you redo. The price is gone and again loss. So in simple words. Loss loss loss and harrasment","App is gud but having some issue in open orders my open orders are still showing pending after 2 days which is not good as compare to other apps. Add another window in which we can directly purchased coins instead of waiting more on open orders. Coindcx is having separate window for dis. If u fix dis issue I will give 5 star","Worst aap ever, every time there was a problem with authenticator code or disable 2fa, it's has been 8 days my account is not responding, and after i book a ticket there is no response from support team. You have to improve you response and fix a bug lot of people are suffering","Every thing you done is great in this application. But there is some issues like lagging, not responding, and yes, make it remember my trading tool's like rsi, macd, all lines. Every time I have to redone everything and it's so frustrating. I am looking forward with this application. All though great great job with all the features. Keep it up and we will keep supporting team bit.

Has a great function where it calculates your profit or loss in it's own graph that most sites dont have.

If I buy a stock at .01 and it goes up to. 02 it won't let me sell at the higher price. Just lays pending. If I try and sell at the .01 prc even when it is at .02 it will accept right away showing the asking price higher than the actual price.

Leave a review if you‚Äôre enjoying the improvements.","comments":["It was decent to use but the lack of backing up your info apart from having to manually record a 12word recovery phrase is so annoying and needs to be addressed in this modern day where everything is stored on our phones. Edit: I know that it's secure - too secure! My office got broken into and all my paperwork destroyed. Making excuses oppose to listening to those who use your app is just poor customer service and am now reducing my rating to 1 because of that.","My experience has been so good, i felt i needed to write a review for others who need a good wallet and cant decide based on others feedback. The app is so user friendly. Is very easy on the eyes. Is super quick. Ive downloaded close to 15 other wallet apps and with BRD i transferred in some BCH (bitcoin cash) the transfers were lightening speed. Literally in split seconds. And network fees $0.00. Wallet fees? $0.00. Yes it cost me absolutely nothing to send BCH in split seconds. I love it 5/5.","I tested this app when it first came out some years ago. Back then it was by far one of the best wallets available and it still is! Security is strong and it has a host of useful features such as the ability to import encrypted private keys from paper wallets you may have cold storage. It also allows you to sweep both BTC and bitcoin cash from wallets created pra to any forks. Don't be put off by some of the negative reviews, if you read them you will find most of them are unreasonable.","Pretty good app for the most part but sometimes you will get an error message when trying to trade between cryptos and it only give a error code and does not tell you what went wrong. Most of the ti.e it is because the app doesn't want you to transfer all of your coin to another coin. For ie. If I have $500 in BTC and want to put that all into ETH I will get an error code. Now if I leave $20 in my BTC and transfer the rest it works pretty good. Buy BRD coin you will save money in trading coin.","Horrible app for your crypto wallet. As soon as my last few transactions clear I am uninstalling. I have been using this app for over a year now and it has literally got worse over time. Transactions take forever for no reason. Overcharge for everything. Trust me...find another wallet.

Used to be good. Then they removed nano, which made sense at the time because of the spam attack. Then it got fixed but nano never returned. You can now ONLY withdraw bitcoin and it's worth like one third the amount you used to get. The \"latest updates\" you see on the google play page is false advertising, front and center. Don't know why they get away with it. Cherry on top - the support team has called it quits.","Used to be good, now insanely low rewards and forces you to pay the BTC miner fees, so you get next to nothing after a ton of work.","Pretty good app, at least it used to be before the pointless (pun intended) update where the points earned no longer go towards Nano currency. Now it's only super inflated Bitcoin where earnings are so low that you couldn't afford even a can of beans after what you would make in a month's time. Not too happy but devs use this comment and take it as a learning experience. Fix your app. You will have my patience and kindness.","Not bad for the type of app it is. Avoid Pollfish surveys as they will lead you through a full length survey then not reward anything. InBrain surveys are hit or miss whether they reward anything at all leading them to be a time sink. Theorem Reach surveys will typically award at least something. The other app related opportunities pretty much don't reward anything. Update: seems all the surveys are now done by Lucid, which requires a lot of unnecessary cookies allowing them to track too much.","3 stars - I've had a lot of fun in the past year with this app, I've made over 50$ btc in my free time playing games, just make sure whichever offer wall you use has a customer support section. When points don't come through you have to email the offer wall for customer service. You also have to email Quicrypto customer service if you need to change your wallet address [annoying, but they are nice and helpful] these days the app is glitchy and good offers are hard to find.

Within that timline you'd have to wait to cash out which can take up to 5 business days.

Will update if fixed. Email many times, messaged from the dashboard on website and put in multiple requests for missing Satoshi and not fixed. They keep taking the Satoshi that their customers accumulate on their app. You build up 10,000 plus sat on any or multiple tabs on the app one day it's gone. And they do not respond except to send you an email to update your wallet info. Scam","So.

Edit: I know that it's secure - too secure! My office got broken into and all my paperwork destroyed. Making excuses oppose to listening to those who use your app is just poor customer service and am now reducing my rating to 1 because of that.","My experience has been so good, i felt i needed to write a review for others who need a good wallet and cant decide based on others feedback. The app is so user friendly. Is very easy on the eyes. Is super quick. Ive downloaded close to 15 other wallet apps and with BRD i transferred in some BCH (bitcoin cash) the transfers were lightening speed. Literally in split seconds. And network fees $0.00. Wallet fees? $0.00. Yes it cost me absolutely nothing to send BCH in split seconds. I love it 5/5.","I tested this app when it first came out some years ago. Back then it was by far one of the best wallets available and it still is! Security is strong and it has a host of useful features such as the ability to import encrypted private keys from paper wallets you may have cold storage. It also allows you to sweep both BTC and bitcoin cash from wallets created pra to any forks. Don't be put off by some of the negative reviews, if you read them you will find most of them are unreasonable.","Pretty good app for the most part but sometimes you will get an error message when trying to trade between cryptos and it only give a error code and does not tell you what went wrong. Most of the ti.e it is because the app doesn't want you to transfer all of your coin to another coin. For ie. If I have $500 in BTC and want to put that all into ETH I will get an error code. Now if I leave $20 in my BTC and transfer the rest it works pretty good. Buy BRD coin you will save money in trading coin.","Horrible app for your crypto wallet.

Lots of reviews are to relating to problems with ad rewards which have now been fixed. The interface is absolutely beautiful :) very basic functions but that's what you expect from an idle game. I was surprised that the only currencies are BTC and USD. I was expecting the upgrades such as MON and LTC to result in those becoming in game currencies...but those upgrades are just new devices which mines more BTC.","My second review i have reset a couple times now deleted and redownloaded the game and still the x2 booster for a video ad does not work still. There is no way to get free gems unless you buy them after the initial 50 or so you get. purple buttons on the right side like skip still don't work.

Though if you have any sort of problem then it doesn't get addressed. Customer support is very poor and only reachable by email. It takes ages to get a response and most of the time it will not be a helpful one. Since this app deals with money it takes a huge hit because of customer care as there can't be any trust if you don't get clarification or resolution for your problems.","Good for nothing. Very very slow.. Very less users which means you end up in loss either buying or selling as there are few takers. They just hoard your funds. Can't withdraw. The process to contact customer care is a serious pain. Using this app is just a punishment for crypto lovers. Worst part is order placing. If you use your 100% funds to buy or sell. It tells you insufficient funds and by the time you redo. The price is gone and again loss. So in simple words. Loss loss loss and harrasment","App is gud but having some issue in open orders my open orders are still showing pending after 2 days which is not good as compare to other apps. Add another window in which we can directly purchased coins instead of waiting more on open orders. Coindcx is having separate window for dis. If u fix dis issue I will give 5 star","Worst aap ever, every time there was a problem with authenticator code or disable 2fa, it's has been 8 days my account is not responding, and after i book a ticket there is no response from support team. You have to improve you response and fix a bug lot of people are suffering","Every thing you done is great in this application. But there is some issues like lagging, not responding, and yes, make it remember my trading tool's like rsi, macd, all lines. Every time I have to redone everything and it's so frustrating. I am looking forward with this application. All though great great job with all the features. Keep it up and we will keep supporting team bit.

I use the BCH app too & they r just alike, which isnt a bad thing. One improvement that could be made is in the Playwall offers...they pay good at the very first and then make u play more for less, which is backwards and make me delete games i actually liked in place for what will give more Litoshis. That could be improved...and a lot of the surveys could be too bc there's never any available and i rarely get to finish any .","App works ok but rewards are very poor and need a huge increase, 300 thousand litoshi is worth ¬£0.30 (30 UK pennies) a 30 second add reward can earn you 100 litoshi, 15-20min surveys reward 2p and many of the surveys disqualify you or close when you're 98% complete so you get zero rewards many times. Bitlabs surveys lie and pay out 25% what they advertise at times","You won't make a ton of money but it is consistent . They also do double days. Compared to others I like how it is an actually unit. 4/8 I completed an offer but did not get anything. There are no answers Update 4/26 Playwall offer no longer works Update 5/4 I did get a response. I appreciate. I'm banned too for some reason, even though I used Google play. The developers don't control who is banned. It's the serves they use. Oh well","I've been having problems accessing the playtime offerwall since the last update. Nothing happen when i click on the link of the playtime offerwall. Have emailed the developer but no response. It used to be okay until the latest update.

When you are going to reach the target by working hard... Then this application itself doubles and triples the amount of satoshi you have in your target...

The app is atrocious for shopping/browsing stores through the app. Can't get logged into some stores, can't navigate on others. Back button will have you starting over, etc.","It's a good concept, but the past few times I've played games to get rewards, the reward disappears before I'm able to complete it. It'll say in the rules \"within 20 days of installing\" and I'll go check on the status within 7, and the reward info isn't even available. This has happened to me twice. It doesn't even store it in my history. I'm frustrated.","Ordered some things on Aliexpress. At first, I thought it didn't work, but in a week or so the points showed up for my purchases. Good app, good concept. Can be improved, of course but going in the right direction.","Pretty cool to earn crypto rewards for shopping and playing games on ur phone! When I had an issue receiving a reward, customer service was responsive and resolved the issue quickly.

Has a great function where it calculates your profit or loss in it's own graph that most sites dont have. It even separates the money you deposit vs your p/l.","Finding it tends to not let u sell low even if the stock is at that point. Ex. If I buy a stock at .01 and it goes up to. 02 it won't let me sell at the higher price. Just lays pending. If I try and sell at the .01 prc even when it is at .02 it will accept right away showing the asking price higher than the actual price.

Major problem is the lag which often ends in crashes. Everytime it does that, all the scores and GWEI went with it, leaving you back on level 1. Crashes are very common when you're doing great with your game. It's like it does not favor that you win and make great points. As to the ETH you can earn, it's too minute and almost neglible to even think playing this game for years can change your life in the long run.","Amazing game ! I find myself sitting down for a quick 5-10 game and an hour later I'm still playing. It really does pay out, instantly ! EDIT : 07-25-21 The game used to be 5 stars, now it's a weak 3 star game. Adds have increased 100%. I just scored 32000+ and for that effort, I was given 675 gwei ?!! A score like that should have paid out 4x that amount. Come on team, don't get cheap on us, the price of Ethereum is down. The payout SHOULD GO UP !!!!!!","Does what it says it does. Great mindless game for meetings or when watching TV. If you're going to mess around on Candy Crush, why not get paid for it? I've made some decent cash off of this and it's funding my smaller crypto investments. Yeah, there's ads. You get used to them, especially once you know how long they last. Just put the tv on and look up when an ad comes on. Great app, wish there were more like it.","Pays out easily and quickly with coinbase. 5 stars. The game is fun. BUT!!! constantly glitches and you have to start over. I was just on a roll, my best game. Start of level 6, a flash, and im back at level 1, and my coins are gone! You still get credit for ETH. But its totally deflating, and makes people stop playing. IF THE GAME STOPPED CRASHING ID GIVE 5 STARS AND PLAY MORE. VERY DISAPPOINTED","Sure enough, it pays out Ethereum almost instantly. It's kind of hard to get figured out, though. You need to go into where it says redeem in order to get it sent to your wallet. Doesn't add up fast at all, but it's an all right time waster. And tons of ads, but that should be a given for anyone looking at this kind of thing. I'd love to see a cleaner interface and more information about how much is paid out per point, but that's easy enough to figure out."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.mansoon.cryptopop","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mansoon.cryptopop&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Mining Monitor 4 Mining Pool Hub","description":"Mining Pool Monitor for Miningpoolhub\r\n\r\nUnofficial application for checking your mining on Mining pool hub pools.
