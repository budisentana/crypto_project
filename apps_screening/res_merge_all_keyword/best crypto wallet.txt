I think they need to make it more clear that those arrows on the side are the send and receive buttons. I think they should also display your balance first before they show the price of the cryptocurrency. What I mean is that instead of having to switch to see your balance I think you should have to switch to see the price of what ever cryptocurrency you are on. Other than those two things the app is amazing! 😄👏🏼","This wallet is all we need. More and more coins are added and the best part is that this wallet is user friendly. I highly suggest to use their desktop wallet for best experience. Their support is also superb. I can still remember when I had some issues with my deposits way back in 2017, they were helpful and very professional. Keep it up exodus, cheers!","Slider shows wrong value when you are at 6 months scope - how can be peak of a price graph be 30 while the dip is 50? I do remember when I bought but it is about money it really shouldn't show wrong values. Nice design. I would like to see auto note about price when I did recive or send. And my average - just a lil bit of analytics. ( any price graph has this bug - it is more apparent with scope 1+ month)","The app is indeed very convenient; its design is well suited for everyday crypto needs, however the problem on my phone (which is running Android 8.1) is that the app requires more CPU and RAM resources than the phone is okay dealing with, which results in a significant delay when loading the UI screen for each requested functionality; in short - it's slow. Other than that it's a great tool to have. For legit advice on acquiring Bitcoin with zero investment see cb.run/earn-bitcoin-free","Exodus is by far the best wallet when it comes to UI/UX. Although, it lacks some more advanced features; which keeps it from being my main wallet.

I also wish that there was a way that you could convert USD coin or some other currency to another currency and pay the mining fee with the currency you are trying to convert with rather than pay with ethereum because you might not have any. And dark mode would be great.

Some coins do work, like Bitcoin, but BCH was transferred to this wallet and even after checking the block explorer and seeing that there were 50 confirmations, still no log of the transfer even after 7 hours. People in the U.S. need to keep track of this for tax purposes but it's not too reliable. I'm not sure about all of the coins but LTC is another one that should be examined. Thanks.","Works well keeping in mind its Binance on the Binance blockchains. It does Ethereum Mainnet as well, but will not allow DEX between blockchains. Also will not allow swap between blockchains. So if you have ETH or USDT and want BTC (or visa versa) this will not work for you. Otherwise it is a nice wallet that pays interest on a few held assets (mostly BNB).","It would be the perfect wallet if it had more Binance Smart Chain coin swap options. Dapp browser conflicts with Android Web View sometimes causing loading of exchanges to slow down immensely. Support for ease of access to exchanges is incredible and top quality. In App Price chart is slow to reflect real-time value and tends to lag behind the real time value of coins 9/10 times. In App buy minimum to fund the wallet is painfully high most times.

BUT, BUT, BUT your continuous habit of deleting users transaction history/ID everytime the app is updated is a big FAILURE , y'all really need to find a solution to this issue... There isn't any backup feature which allows TX history/ID to be saved & this can be a big issue for many users from different parts of the globe.... As a early user of TW having access to my TX history/ID is very important .... Pls Fix","I was initially a little upset with Trust Wallet because of some issues I was having, but they have great customer service! Now that I know how to fully use the app, it is very easy and I like it. Edit: I lowered my review to 3 stars. I have used a lot of crypto apps and this is definitely the most difficult one to use.

There was still no resolution so we'll be looking into it. Till the I recommend an honest brokerage.","So far I've not had an issue and hope it continues to be an amazing app!

So I can't finish what I started or even get my $ back. Someone needs to fix this before I post on all of my media pages including the investment group I admit & have them leave bad reviews. I've reached out for days $ NOTHING! I want immediate help & my money returned as it was deposited in full.","I'm finding it incredibly irritating that I transferred some USDC (which wasn't what I meant to buy, I just wanted USD. Very confusing that there is USD & USDC) so now I've got 130$ tied up & stuck in the wallet until I can manage to buy enough Ethereum to be able to pay the transaction fee that can only be paid for in Ethereum.

I use the card for purchases I would make like gas and snack food because you get a little CRO back so I thought why not. Buying coins is easy as well. The only part I don't really understand is the card tiers say you need a minimum staked in dollars to go up a tier, but then when I go to stake there is a minimum written in CRO or whatever other coin I've tried staking. Other than that I really enjoy the app and if you're wanting a debit card for crypto, this one works!","App is not incredibly intuitive, but it's still pretty solid. Only 3 stars because app doesn't work at all in newest version of Android beta, which is currently preventing me from accessing my investments. Reduced another star (now 2) as it's not been a month since the Android 12 beta went public and has even had an update, but this app has still not been fixed. It's the only app that I've encountered that does not work in the beta.","I purchased crypto worth $3,520. I was showing this amount but when the transaction complete I was charged a fee even though it did not show the box where I have to check it and agree to the fee. I contact customer service many times but no luck I told them it was a glitch on their end but the customer service is like a robot.. they just copy and paste.. total scam I do not recommend it. I am in a process to cancel my account.","This is the most complicated app I've ever dealt with for crypto buying selling and tracking. It's takes forever, selling and trading is extremely confusing. Only reason I am using it is ability to buy diverse coins. 1 star is very harsh, but its obvious this app is designed for the educated when it comes to crypto, people new to crypto currency would be better served going somewhere else. Trading, buying, or transferring needs to be made more simple .","Overall the app is nice, that is if you get to open it! I've been using it for 6m now and would like to see faster replies from the customer service agents and limit orders when buying coins. Ah, I didn't get my referral credit too. A bit more generous rewards for staking would be appreciated too. Other than that, it has a nice selection of coins and it's quite easy to use."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"co.mona.android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.mona.android&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Trustee Wallet - best bitcoin and crypto wallet","description":"Trustee is a crypto wallet of a new generation.

All very confusing. We will see. [edit#3]. They eventually refunded me, however based on this experience I still cannot recommend nor give > 2 stars - especially when they ask me to edit the review.

The app auto rotates horizontally but in the wrong way for me. My charge port is on the bottom of my table and my cable is on the left. This auto rotate only flips right and won't flip to the left. So i now have a long cable across my lap because of it and this puts undue stress on the charge. Then when trying to watch a vid in app it flips the other way. Wth! Very annoying! Maybe it is not optimized for a tablet but in this day and age it should be!","Used daily for three months. Love the ability to open a few wallets of the same crypto in order to segregate my transactions. Also can include personal notes for both incoming and outgoing transactions to keep tabs of sending and receiving. Both of these features may not be available in other wallets. Hope to see more crypto supported, so that I can streamline my wallets.","After their new update, converting your crypto to usdt is much more reliable and faster unlike before. I also like that they add bitcoin and ethereum wallet so we can further diversify our portfolio. The clean ui also make the app more friendly to users. However, these past few days, the app ocassionally shows a red notice at the top saying to retry reconnecting to server ( I cant remember the exact words but it looks like that). Overall, the update is excellent. Just a little tweak will do.","One thing I really love with this is that I can create multiple wallets so I can sort out my budgets and funds. Got issues on the past but good thing the support team helps me to sort things out and fixed it. Highly recommended for it's very fast transactions and very minimal fees. A must have for crypto users.","Terrible way to buy BTC, first time using app tried buying BTC and all my purchases kept declining for no reason it was 1 out of 9 times it finally went though, and now I tried giving the app a second chance and went to buy some more BTC and first try the order went though but I havnt received my BTC for some reason because it's STUCK ON VERIFYING my bank was charged what needs to be verified????, it's been 4hours and I still havnt gotten my BTC, terrible app."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.bitcoin.mwallet","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bitcoin.mwallet&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"BRD Bitcoin Wallet.

Edit: I know that it's secure - too secure! My office got broken into and all my paperwork destroyed. Making excuses oppose to listening to those who use your app is just poor customer service and am now reducing my rating to 1 because of that.","My experience has been so good, i felt i needed to write a review for others who need a good wallet and cant decide based on others feedback. The app is so user friendly. Is very easy on the eyes. Is super quick. Ive downloaded close to 15 other wallet apps and with BRD i transferred in some BCH (bitcoin cash) the transfers were lightening speed. Literally in split seconds. And network fees $0.00. Wallet fees? $0.00. Yes it cost me absolutely nothing to send BCH in split seconds. I love it 5/5.","I tested this app when it first came out some years ago. Back then it was by far one of the best wallets available and it still is! Security is strong and it has a host of useful features such as the ability to import encrypted private keys from paper wallets you may have cold storage. It also allows you to sweep both BTC and bitcoin cash from wallets created pra to any forks. Don't be put off by some of the negative reviews, if you read them you will find most of them are unreasonable.","Pretty good app for the most part but sometimes you will get an error message when trying to trade between cryptos and it only give a error code and does not tell you what went wrong. Most of the ti.e it is because the app doesn't want you to transfer all of your coin to another coin. For ie. If I have $500 in BTC and want to put that all into ETH I will get an error code. Now if I leave $20 in my BTC and transfer the rest it works pretty good. Buy BRD coin you will save money in trading coin.","Horrible app for your crypto wallet. As soon as my last few transactions clear I am uninstalling. I have been using this app for over a year now and it has literally got worse over time. Transactions take forever for no reason.

I gave it 4 stars because it is not completely perfect to use and navigate, transaction history does not reflect all the transactions made by me whether it is sending or receiving coins and I wish the notifications of this app is working or is it just me because I am using an older version of android 8. I hope you can fix this and overall it is a good app not great.","This has got to be the worst crypto wallet I've ever used. Tons of bugs and glitches, complicated staking procedures, and the fees are very high. On top of that I lost coins due to a problem with the wallet and customer service is simply incapable of understanding my problem or helping. My advice would be to stay away from this app.","Works well for me and I do recommend. Sometimes it takes a little time for transactions to go through but this is true for most transactions of this type. One thing to makes sure is you keep enough etherum to pay for the transaction if that is what is used for the fees. So just don't zero it out is what I am saying.","Great app for a beginner, such as myself. More up and coming coins need to be added. The ability to sell and trade coins directly thru the wallet would make it the best on the market. And if you really want to solidify #1 spot, bring the community of AWC users together like they've done on my favorite trading platform.","Great app, easy to use. So many nice features. Could use some added features. It's hard to know what your total returns on investments is since it doesn't keep track of where you stared. Haven't had great success in identifying if I've made anything on my staking crypto either.

However, there is an annoying announcement / ad banner at start of the app every time which can only be closed with the cross button situated at the top corner of the screen. Due to the large screen phones today, closing this banner requires a two hand manoeuvre which is really poor design according to me and is also annoying to be receiving the banner in the first place. Banners should be placed in a manner that is non-obtrusive and secondly user should be able.","Awesome. It's good that many coins are added, but it's confusing. Showing different page per currency isn't comfortable. There must a single page of all coins available with current prices and even columns with what we hold of them. And then when we touch the respective coin we could see history and price chart while whatever we hold too should be shown at once and total price of what we hold too. There were no such monthly charges when i was using wazirx earlier. This rule has come later.","1. App user interface is not intuitive. 2. While doing KYC if you accidently go back, you will need to refill the info. 3. Also if KYC rejected, whole form needed to be refilled. 4. Not sure where can we see price timeline for coins. It is very important to showcase that at very main screeen. 5. While adding INR money, options provided are only mobikwik even though it shows UPI verified.","Great. Very easy to understand and invest in crypto using this App. Best app out there in market for investing in crypto. Easy to navigate and very easy to understand and you can see prices of crypto updating every second. Much impressed with this app and withdraws and deposits are very easy in this app. The charts for each individual token/coin load very slow and sometimes non responsive with no axes labels. One cannot see the trend over time on the app easily. Wish we had more data and notes.","Really, amazing! This app only has a big name else than that there is nothing about it. About a month ago I placed an order for a shoe. And I received a different product then what i had ordered for, so the very same day I requested for a exchange. Unlike other shopping site Wazirx had quiet a complicated exchange process where in we need to provide all if proof and stuff. But as asked by Wazirx I emailed them my Adhar card as an ID proof and later again I sent my passport because Wazirx said."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.wrx.wazirx","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wrx.wazirx&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"TokenPocket Wallet.

I really wanted to give 5 stars but the app failed to update after a recent transaction stating that I am offline. I found that I had to clear cache then restart, for it to work properly. Therefore only 4 stars for now. EDIT: after trying the built-in exchange I have removed another star from my review. Like others described before me the fees are higher than expected. DO NOT use the exchange service.","Easy to use, high transaction fees (but that's the bitcoin miner fee, it's the same no matter what wallet is used), only thing keeping it from being 5 stars is the fact that the minimum for exchanging altcoims is 52 euro which is quite high (as in, if I want to convert BTC to etherium, I have to convert a minimum of 52 euro worth) but overall a good, safe, easy to use app.","Wallet fees are ridiculous. Total Wallet amounts sometimes freeze so you have to reload multiple times for aggregate dollar amounts to show correctly. Ain't nobody got time for that foolishness. Update 5/5/2021: Based on feedback from Jaxx I will adjust my overall rating from 2 stars to 3 stars. If Jaxx can improve the crypto aggregate so that it's more reliable I will adjust my rating again. Thank you for your feedback. That piece of information you shared is helpful for my understanding.","Not good for new users. I tried to move and then trade around $400 USD of crypto coins and it says there is not enough money to do the transaction. The money is stuck there. This apparently this is nothing to do the makers of the wallet but they could have given some indication this was the case. I am new the crypto but I has no idea it costs more than $400 to move coins to another wallet or to an exchange.

Bad move for a young company. Still trying to get the app to work. Will try to remember to update once I have an update to post.","Beware!! App works and the MasterCard works great. There is an undocumented \"miners fee.\" For a $50 Bitcoin to card transfer there was $3.35 Bitcoin fee and a $25 \"miners fee,\" beware!!","Absolutely horrible. They charge fees to load your account and fees to use your card. Out of an initial $50 usd I deposited to set the account up and get my card, there was $12 left. And when you go to withdraw that $12 of btc, the transaction fee is higher than the amount you want to withdraw. Add $100 cash, and you only receive $86","Experience sucked and is Continue to suck. Sent me a card I loaded it from XRP I moved to bitpay and used it.Had 18.54 and 311 XRP still available.Card can no longer be loaded and MasterCard services says they no longer support the Bitpay card and cannot help and of course they are not responding to email.

My money is in my original which I still can't get them to give me any way to access it. Bottom line ...don't trust them with your money! I have talked to others that have the same problem. Don't trust Abra!","Nothing special about its features. The interest earning options require a KYC application with Prime Trust. My application was pending for over 2 months with no explanation. My repeated attempts to get more information resulted in automated, bot generated emails, and no action. ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE customer service!!! At least I was able to take my BTC out.","They are saying that it's wallet has it's own unique recovery phrase, but when I login in my recovery phrase I can't recover my account anymore, my investment was gone. I did my verification of identity but it stuck me, there's no way to proceed. hoping they will improve their system. I've lost my 300 Canadian dollars. it was.","Why does it all me to update my app all the time when there is no update available? They claim no fees but they get you on the spread. Comes out close to what Coinbase charges, only CB is transparent about it. I've had the app for 3 days but got a message today saying I had to update it to use it. So I go to update it. There's no update available. You can't do limit orders.","Multiple attempts over the past four months to verify KYC proved futile, even when app confirms successful completion of verification process. All requests for assistance through Abra's customer service yield no results in rectifying the issue. Not only does it take customer service, in average, three weeks to respond to inquiries, but their response is always the same; to follow the app step by step guide to complete KYC verification."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.plutus.wallet","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.plutus.wallet&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Paxful - Bitcoin & Crypto Wallet, Marketplace P2P","description":"Paxful is a peer-to-peer platform for buying, selling, and trading digital currencies.

But I want to talk about the recent update of trade menu. there is not any option to see the exact market price of the particular trade. previously that option was quite helpful whenever the market was fluctuating but now it creates confusion and have to use calculator to see the exact market amount of particular trade please help","Unable to verify my phone number every time app showing an error and notify try after some time, along with that website is also very poor saying enter a valid phone. Worst app i have ever seen. What should i do by contact support there is a automated reply by bot, redirecting me on a page to tell me how to verify phone. That is really idiotic thing bg paxful. You need to fix the issue at you app and website.","Its a really good platform for trade ,But suddenly my offers went to unresponsive list bottom of the list which means they are not in their position and i raised alot of tickets contact support dont have proper answer for that they saying our system have new ranking procedure but evn i have more thn 100 positive feedbacks without any single negative one how can my offers went down in unresponsive or unactive list?? Plz confirm it and get my offers in their original positions please....","Take much time on one trade,another fast option should be initiated,i think it like auto option,one person want to sell and fix the rate for sell,should be his name and bank account mention on trade page. Buyer just see and send money to his account, and escrow release the currncy. Why the chat option is initiated when the person want to sell,just wastage of time, Should be fast,your prosses is very slow and disappouting.","Edit: got scammed (didn't follow guides- lesson learned). The app lets you pay someone, then cancel the trade without seller confirming they've refunded :\\ Used in-app reporting, but nothing happened. Later learned you have to raise a support ticket to quickly sort disputes. However, support was great once they were on it, and won the dispute pretty quickly. There's a slightly frustrating learning curve, and UI can be a bit clunky, but once you find how to get help they're good.

Cant figure this out.","MetaMask is a great crypto wallet, makes swaps easy to do without going through all the swap providers individually. I think the negative reviews here are from a lack of understanding on how to use MetaMask, such as adding tokens so your balance shows then.

Not to mention the lack of basis portfolio visualization features and the fact we have two different apps from the same company.","Very disappointing app. I thought pro meant it was going to give me a lot of control over charts and indicators, but it's way too basic. I tried Binance and it provides a rich experience with a lot of customizability. I can actually zoom in and out and drag charts around, rather than this which is just fixed. Not trader friendly at all.","Absolutely horrible platform! I had $110 in Eth and tried to withdrawal some to pay someone. Turns out the authenticator had issues, I had to get my account unlocked, now I can't withdraw my money. Customer service is non-existent with coin base either. I can't reach anyone and my support tickets continue to get rejected. If I could speak with someone that could help me resolve this issue then i would be ok with the situation.

Unfortunately I don't believe this is the crypto app for me, mostly because the minimum is $100 and that's just way more than I'm willing to spend, although that's more of a person finance issue and not their fault, it's just a shame. Other than that, I would say the biggest (CON) for me is the app will say oops error and I have to close and reopen, in order to go back to where I was.","Updated review: the issue I previously had with the savings has now been resolved, with good CS. Beautiful UX with just one star off for some minor bugs, that are only bothersome sometimes, otherwise don't effect the overall usage of the app/wallet. If you want a simple, trustworthy wallet to buy, trade, earn or simply just store your crypto (and I've tried a few) I so far would recommend ZenGo for sure.","Very straight forward, great experience on a mobile device.

They did it with the utmost expertise and best customer service ever on an app involving cryptocurrency. The issue was resolved in less than 2 working days.

And they STILL have not fixed the problem for me 2 months later. They refer me to their financial company whom then gives me the run around.

I do NOT recommend them to any new users. You've been warned.","I would have to say that Blockfolio is the worst. For 3 months I've tried too get help with my account and the error codes on my account and still haven't received any help.

But that said, it has a lot of flaws in my opinion. Not only is it slow to update coin prices, but the hidden and fluctuating fees make it obnoxious to use, to say the least. Rather than taking a given cut of each transaction, it raises the price per coin (or lowers when selling) to take a percentage. But this changes so often that it's impossible to accurately Buy and sell when you want to."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.blockfolio.blockfolio","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blockfolio.blockfolio&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"TronLink Pro - The Best TRON Wallet","description":"🏆Serves over 90% of all TRON users.

Major issue here is that dev team forget to take antiparanoia pills and start taking some real world lessons. So whats the deal? First you need for many operation get signature by so called \"cold wallet\", there is NO WAY to disable this feature, perhaps noone from the team heard about Google based 2FA or perhaps curse word \"biometrics\", but yea, there is workaround where you need nothing less than second phone just for this shite on top of that without internet connection. I am using this only for staking few tokens acquired by accident. So after locking period expire the plan is to dump the shitcoin with this \"wallet\" without any regrets.","Love the app but it will NOT let me send XMR (Monero) coins to a wallet or exchange after they were sent to me, tells me invalid address and I've tried 5 different wallets and exchanges. It doesn't even show the market value for XMR and many other coins nor can I swap for TRX or other coins! Please fix your issues.","I have some questions why it isn't able to send Bitcoin from Tronlink Pro to another BTC wallet address? The transaction always fails. Also the Energy is too high for reductions of transactions. The Tron Lending for energy is too expensive.","I do not know why people are rating this app poorly, they prevented me from downloading it earlier thinking that what they were saying was true. I assure you that this is by far the Best tron wallet out there (and Yes, I have tried alot). Please read more on how to use it (though not that technical) and avoid the fake airdrops requiring you to swap. Keep it up.","Reading the reviews seems like the people giving the app 1 star really don't know how to us the app tronlink works perfectly without any issues."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.tronlinkpro.wallet","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tronlinkpro.wallet&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Infinito Wallet - Crypto Wallet & DApp Browser","description":"★ Community's Choice Crypto Mobile App ★\r\n- Free, secure, simple.\r\n- Buy crypto directly in wallet.\r\n- Universal wallet & DApp browser for: BTC, ETH, XLM, BCH, LTC, DASH, DOGE, NEO, GAS, ETC, EOS, ADA, ONT, BNB, TOMO, TRON, ATOM, IRIS, USDT, INFT, ERC20, NEP-5, BEP-2, TRC-10 tokens.\r\n- Truly decentralized: You control private key, passphrases and passwords.\r\n- Recommended as \"Best crypto wallet\" on Cryptocompare, Trustpilot, Cryptowisser, Coinlist, ICO Rating…\r\n\r\nWHO SHOULD USE INFINITO WALLET?\r\n✔ Crypto newbie: all you need in one easy-to-use app with step-by-step Blog guide & 24/7 Helpdesk.\r\n\r\n✔ Seasoned expert: manage portfolio, price tracking & instant exchange with few taps!

A must get!","Mostly good, except your Monero is broken. I currently have 1.77μ. I can not use it, however, because your app says I have a spendable balance of 0. No ... I have 1.77μ. It says it right there, right under where it says I don't. I better still have my coin.","Consistent reduction in quality of releases. More and more errors and bugs with each release they attempt to improve UI on. Edge devs, are you aware that plummeting UX is not a solution to a UI that could be improved upon? Incorrect amounts being sent, issues sending period... I've had edge for a long time now, but it's time to uninstall. As a dev, I would be ashamed of this failure of a development team.","I finally found the only wallet than got accepted for a specific app. I looked everywhere, tried many wallets but none worked. Until i found this one. I can't appreciate how easy and secure it is to create an account. No email. What i also like is how you can keep everything under your watch and be up to date with any changes made to the cryptocurrencies. I recommend it to everyone needing a nice, secure and convenient wallet"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"co.edgesecure.app","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.edgesecure.app&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Samourai Wallet","description":"Samourai Wallet is the most feature rich and advanced bitcoin wallet available on Android today.

Anyways, I have a lifetime subscription and I would like to create/delete root categories. It seems right now that's impossible and I think it should be a core feature. Everyone has different needs across different kinds of spending based on their own lives e.g. having children or not, owning a house, a car, loans, rentals, etc.","The app has some good features. It shows multiple currency and updates automatically with the bank. A feature I couldn't find with any other app. However, every now and then it loses connection to the bank and is unable to connect and get your updates. This will go on for multiple days or may not get resolved at all. Wallet needs to improve on the way the allow you to show bills and really needs to fix bank connectivity issue. It is painful.","I purchased the app based on a few days trial. Now, they don't offer support to any of my banks or credit cards except one. They don't even allow adding Amazon Pay account! There are at least 4 complaints I've filed in the past one month, none even addressed properly. At the bare minimum, cancel my subscription and return the money. Giving support during trial period and disconnecting the bank accounts after the purchase is cheating.","App was great. But now it is useless for me. Ban automatic synchronization is generally broken time to time (even before 90 days period). Evenmore reconnect feature in the app doesn't work for me (even after completing the process successfully). Some alternative manual workaround options were provided such as connecting saltegde web site and do some manual stuff. But if I need to do this everytime, then it doesn't make sense for me to use the app.Please fix bank automatic synchronization problem","Loved the app, but now it's useless for me. Main selling point for me was the bank transaction integration but they dropped support of my bank.

I need an app that works as fast taking money OUT as it does putting money IN. This isn't it. I'm missing some outstanding buy opportunities right now because of this app. UPDATE: Finally got my money. Deleting. Too slow to be useful for trades.","I will update this, once they start replying and updating \"email tickets\" appropriately. For no reason, my account was \"blacklisted\" and I am unable to buy or sell. Reached out via their ticketing system, only to have my ticket redirected to another team and have not heard back for over a week on anything being completed. No follow through or at least response to my questions. Also, if you ask or respond to their email, it kicks you back in que.

The only option given is international money wire!.This takes days, and your charged a fair amount to transfer YOUR money to YOUR account!

I Added 1 star because it is much better now but it's still not as fast as it should and another star for great customer support. I appreciate the app very much as it is very helpful to keep track of my crypto assets. Hopefully with the next update I can give it 5*.","The buttons are unresponsive, and there is a long lag time. I often have to open and close the app just to get it responsive again. Also, when scrolling between portfolios, the process lags as well with a blank screen coming up when I try to scroll between portfolios instead of seeing the actual portfolio. This is highly frustrating. I would like a developer to please get in contact with me. Having to tap these buttons 10x over for just one action is really grating. Awful user experience.","Be warned: They double charged me for one deposit. And they STILL have not fixed the problem for me 2 months later. They refer me to their financial company whom then gives me the run around. Eventually they said a refund was coming but it never came. They seem very unorganized at best, and possibly fraudulent at worst. I will not be depositing another dollar into this company. I do NOT recommend them to any new users. You've been warned.","I would have to say that Blockfolio is the worst. For 3 months I've tried too get help with my account and the error codes on my account and still haven't received any help. I've tried to withdraw both cryptocurrency and USD coins and it will not let me. I've reached out to support on that as well and again, NO HELP.

However, there is an annoying announcement / ad banner at start of the app every time which can only be closed with the cross button situated at the top corner of the screen. Due to the large screen phones today, closing this banner requires a two hand manoeuvre which is really poor design according to me and is also annoying to be receiving the banner in the first place. Banners should be placed in a manner that is non-obtrusive and secondly user should be able.","Awesome. It's good that many coins are added, but it's confusing. Showing different page per currency isn't comfortable. There must a single page of all coins available with current prices and even columns with what we hold of them. And then when we touch the respective coin we could see history and price chart while whatever we hold too should be shown at once and total price of what we hold too. There were no such monthly charges when i was using wazirx earlier. This rule has come later.","1. App user interface is not intuitive. 2. While doing KYC if you accidently go back, you will need to refill the info. 3. Also if KYC rejected, whole form needed to be refilled. 4. Not sure where can we see price timeline for coins. It is very important to showcase that at very main screeen. 5. While adding INR money, options provided are only mobikwik even though it shows UPI verified.","Great. Very easy to understand and invest in crypto using this App. Best app out there in market for investing in crypto. Easy to navigate and very easy to understand and you can see prices of crypto updating every second. Much impressed with this app and withdraws and deposits are very easy in this app. The charts for each individual token/coin load very slow and sometimes non responsive with no axes labels. One cannot see the trend over time on the app easily. Wish we had more data and notes.","Really, amazing! This app only has a big name else than that there is nothing about it. About a month ago I placed an order for a shoe. And I received a different product then what i had ordered for, so the very same day I requested for a exchange. Unlike other shopping site Wazirx had quiet a complicated exchange process where in we need to provide all if proof and stuff.

This should help with the syncing. The Dogecoin network has been a bit overwhelmed with the influx of new users. Work to improve this is being done as we speak. This isn&#39;t really a problem with this app, so bear with it ;)<br>- Fixed calculation of fees. No more stuck transactions because of low fees!<br>- Updated checkpoints to massively reduce the amount of syncing for new and recently created and restore wallets.<br><br>DON&#39;T USE FOR MINING POOL OR FAUCET PAYOUTS!","comments":["Synchronised in reasonable time to show my balance from a backup a few months ago. Sent a test amount to my binance wallet and was there in about half an hour. Did the rest after and it transferred in minutes. If you know what you're doing, have good internet, and understand there can be strain on the network, then you'll be fine with this app.","Peer selection needs more work. Constantly falling behind the network as peers can not be found or are found for just a few seconds before being dropped. This causes transactions to be stuck for several hours. May be an issue with the network, but doesn't seem to be something I experience with my other Doge wallets.","Any other wallet application which has received love in the past several years is 1000x more reliable than this. Coinomi is a far better choice. Syncing took ages, was unreliable, and sending was even less reliable. 4 blockchain refreshes didn't fix transactions not being broadcast, despite being fully synced. Restore options are antiquated. Modern wallets use simple seed restore words. This requires manual decryption of a backup file.","I had processed a send coin order to one of my addresses, the transfer has not yet taken place. It has been 3 months and the transfer has not been completed yet. All I see is a message \"Currently payments are not possible because a replay is in progress\". I fear my coins will be stuck in this wallet forever.","Wallet is 10 weeks behind. My coin disappeared. Maybe ill see it when the blocks catch up. Good thing I only sent a small amount to test waters. I sent from Gemini. Was extra careful to make sure I copied the correct receiving wallet. If it takes this long to put money into the wallet, could only imagine if I wanted to take it out EDIT: Took full day for blocks to update. Suspect from recent addition of doge into Gemini.

You loose. When you want to set a limit order, it gives you EUR currency, but I want to set in USD! Since I trade BTC/USD, not BTC/EUR! When you buy crypto, app buys it higher than standard market price, possible they create price gap + app takes big commission. Limit orders are very inconvenient and useless.","Would be better if it supported deposits and withdrawals with all the currencies it offers and not just 4 or 5, but the fees for sending/withdrawing bitcoin are a total rob so I don't know if I'd even use it.

DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE Once again I have to file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau.","Super easy to use. Nice to be able to fund asap unlike a lot of other exchanges or custodians. Entry to the crypto space is great. Following areas of improvement: the \"Slide/Swipe\" to buy is a bit weird as I'd prefer something like a button with less motion. The app could be made more snappier. Scrolling left/right to holdings performance is a bit weird. But aside from all that, I'm a fan of the product and business model. THE INTEREST IS JUST AWESOME 😎.","Be ready to pay a premium. You will always buy at the ask price and sell at the bid price. The difference on the app is 2-5%. So potentially u will lose 5% when you buy and when you sell. Most good exchanges the difference is way less than .05%... Here you are in the hole 10% by the time you cash out. Crypto withdrawal fees are highest in business as well.. over $40 for some tokens, compared to $2-4 for others. That said the app is very easy to use and UI is great. Worth it?- you decide","#SHIBARMY ALL THE WAY! Thanks for listing! Update: After posting my review I read others and I am confused with the latest comments. I've used Voyager for about a month and a half and it has been nothing but a great app. I have never experienced any lag on transferring fiat to and from the app. Never any issues with buying or converting crypto; no issues what so ever. Don't know what they mean, Voyager is one of the easiest apps to invest in crypto.","Started off okay. Not sure about the fees but my issue is that I can't log in or change my password due to \"internal server issues\". This has been going on for weeks now.

It features USDX − a stable cryptocurrency pegged to the U.S. Dollar.  Setting up an account in the wallet takes only a minute. And best of all, there are no fees for payments in USDX.\r\n\r\nThe wallet’s security is implemented at multiple levels. The primary defense is asymmetric cryptography, which is an essential component of cryptocurrencies. Your private key is encrypted and stored safely; only you can decrypt it and perform transactions. The use of distributed ledger technology ensures that all transactions are irreversible. Moreover, your account is linked to your mobile phone number, preventing unauthorized access and enabling two-step authentication. Every transaction must be confirmed with a code from a push notification or SMS. Lastly, the app auto-locks after several minutes of inactivity and requires a PIN code, fingerprint or face scanning to unlock.\r\n\r\nUSDX cryptocurrency is pegged to the much-used USD at a 1:1 ratio, making it easy to figure out your balance or calculate the amount to transfer. Having no transaction fees, USDX stablecoin acts perfectly as a means of payment.\r\n\r\nThe Lighthouse coin, or LHT, is a core cryptocurrency of the USDX Wallet. The total supply of LHT is 1B coins, which will be released gradually to the market. A smart contract ensures that each USDX token is collateralized with at least 200% worth of LHT currency. Only 10% of the LHT supply will be issued each year, of which 5% will be freely tradeable and 5% will be locked on the blockchain to provide 200% collateralization.\r\n\r\nWhy choose USDX Wallet\r\n\r\n✔️ Zero fees\r\nWe want a stable currency to be available for everybody - so we’ve eliminated commissions. Make borderless transfers with 0% fee.\r\n\r\n✔️ Fast and easy transactions\r\nInstantly send funds to your friends by mobile phone number, name from Contacts, their USDX Wallet account name, or personal QR code. Easily repeat regular transactions. Get your real-time balance and a full history of transactions at any time.\r\n\r\n✔️ High-grade security\r\nDue to blockchain technology, all wallet transactions are verified, stored in a distributed ledger and can’t be compromised. Each transaction is confirmed using two-factor authentication (2FA). This means your funds are safely protected against seizure and it’s nearly impossible to make a transfer without your permission. For extra security, the app requires a fingerprint, a face-scanning or a PIN code upon every entry and after some period of inactivity.\r\n\r\n✔️ Money-back guarantee\r\nIf you’re not satisfied with the service, we will return your money back, no questions asked. \r\n\r\n\r\nHow to get USDX or LHT?\r\nYou can buy USDX and LHT currencies for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Dash and over 50 Altcoins right in the app. Also, you can exchange LHT for USDX and vice versa at any time without paying additional fees. Coins are currently listed on four exchanges: Exrates.me, Exmarkets.com, P2PB2B.io and Alterdice.com. More exchanges are coming soon.\r\n\r\nStay tuned as we are constantly adding new features to make USDX Wallet more powerful and convenient 💪🏻.

My other recommendation would be to add the value of the investments into the app. Currently you can see the current trade price of a token e.g. AUSDTLPM but this differs from the value you receive if you unstaked via the web site. Generally as an \"investment\" it would make more sense to show this as opposed to an exchange traded price of the token.","One of the worst app and staff. I was communicated with them throught chat. When they are unable to solve my issue they block my chat section. I was think that may be technical error but that may be resolved with in hours. I wait three day. I would like to give them in minus but no option.","DO NOT USE WAVES.EXCHANGE. I have money locked up, and I can't transfer it out, because they disabled the gateway. Support is useless, and can't even give an ETA or reason. They said I should just exchange it for waves, but there is NO liquidity. Unacceptable.

The app is clean & functional. However, for over a month now they have blocked me from withdrawing dogecoin due to \"technical issues\" that they are unwilling to elaborate on. Everyone's suspicion is that they are insolvent, or, at the very least, manipulating the market. And to make matters worse, tickets go unanswered and when you question them about it on Telegram and Reddit, they block you.","Don't ever go with this exchange. I'm unable to login with 2FA as I changed my phone. Even after providing all the information over the mail thread started with the ticket, I'm not getting any response. I fear I would ever get singed into my account. Ticket#787115 Update: when I posted this, their team immediately replied this review pretending they care about their customers. But still no response to the ticket and my all money is lost. This is a real scam.","Worst experience using this app, they charge you ridiculous fees for withdrawal and the platform itself is stupid as it has no wallet so you need to have another wallet if you wish to take your own money out (whatevers left of it after theyve taken their massive cut) and yes they will claim they charge this fees for a safe transaction but others also have safe transactions but you dont see them overcharging!! Please do not use this!!","Worst crypto app. Trying for a month and half to restore my 2-FA due to device loss and still no answer from support. Provided everything they asked for: ID, contract hash numbers, and verification selfie. Not a word since. Strongly suggest to keep your funds away. Ticket is 760248- please release my account.","Horrible app extremely high fees even though it's flat but still it's higher than any app I've used. Withdrawal is a nightmare. Don't bother replying with the bot here 'we are sorry bla bla bla ' yet you ain't doing nothing because of your horrible customer service.

It features USDX − a stable cryptocurrency pegged to the U.S. Dollar.  Setting up an account in the wallet takes only a minute. And best of all, there are no fees for payments in USDX.\r\n\r\nThe wallet’s security is implemented at multiple levels. The primary defense is asymmetric cryptography, which is an essential component of cryptocurrencies. Your private key is encrypted and stored safely; only you can decrypt it and perform transactions. The use of distributed ledger technology ensures that all transactions are irreversible. Moreover, your account is linked to your mobile phone number, preventing unauthorized access and enabling two-step authentication. Every transaction must be confirmed with a code from a push notification or SMS. Lastly, the app auto-locks after several minutes of inactivity and requires a PIN code, fingerprint or face scanning to unlock.\r\n\r\nUSDX cryptocurrency is pegged to the much-used USD at a 1:1 ratio, making it easy to figure out your balance or calculate the amount to transfer. Having no transaction fees, USDX stablecoin acts perfectly as a means of payment.\r\n\r\nThe Lighthouse coin, or LHT, is a core cryptocurrency of the USDX Wallet. The total supply of LHT is 1B coins, which will be released gradually to the market. A smart contract ensures that each USDX token is collateralized with at least 200% worth of LHT currency. Only 10% of the LHT supply will be issued each year, of which 5% will be freely tradeable and 5% will be locked on the blockchain to provide 200% collateralization.\r\n\r\nWhy choose USDX Wallet\r\n\r\n✔️ Zero fees\r\nWe want a stable currency to be available for everybody - so we’ve eliminated commissions. Make borderless transfers with 0% fee.\r\n\r\n✔️ Fast and easy transactions\r\nInstantly send funds to your friends by mobile phone number, name from Contacts, their USDX Wallet account name, or personal QR code. Easily repeat regular transactions. Get your real-time balance and a full history of transactions at any time.\r\n\r\n✔️ High-grade security\r\nDue to blockchain technology, all wallet transactions are verified, stored in a distributed ledger and can’t be compromised. Each transaction is confirmed using two-factor authentication (2FA). This means your funds are safely protected against seizure and it’s nearly impossible to make a transfer without your permission. For extra security, the app requires a fingerprint, a face-scanning or a PIN code upon every entry and after some period of inactivity.\r\n\r\n✔️ Money-back guarantee\r\nIf you’re not satisfied with the service, we will return your money back, no questions asked. \r\n\r\n\r\nHow to get USDX or LHT?\r\nYou can buy USDX and LHT currencies for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Dash and over 50 Altcoins right in the app. Also, you can exchange LHT for USDX and vice versa at any time without paying additional fees. Coins are currently listed on four exchanges: Exrates.me, Exmarkets.com, P2PB2B.io and Alterdice.com. More exchanges are coming soon.\r\n\r\nStay tuned as we are constantly adding new features to make USDX Wallet more powerful and convenient 💪🏻.
