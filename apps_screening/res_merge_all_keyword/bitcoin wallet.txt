Love the ability to open a few wallets of the same crypto in order to segregate my transactions. Also can include personal notes for both incoming and outgoing transactions to keep tabs of sending and receiving. Both of these features may not be available in other wallets. Hope to see more crypto supported, so that I can streamline my wallets.","After their new update, converting your crypto to usdt is much more reliable and faster unlike before. I also like that they add bitcoin and ethereum wallet so we can further diversify our portfolio. The clean ui also make the app more friendly to users. However, these past few days, the app ocassionally shows a red notice at the top saying to retry reconnecting to server ( I cant remember the exact words but it looks like that). Overall, the update is excellent. Just a little tweak will do.","One thing I really love with this is that I can create multiple wallets so I can sort out my budgets and funds. Got issues on the past but good thing the support team helps me to sort things out and fixed it. Highly recommended for it's very fast transactions and very minimal fees.

Most of the ti.e it is because the app doesn't want you to transfer all of your coin to another coin. For ie. If I have $500 in BTC and want to put that all into ETH I will get an error code.

Some coins do work, like Bitcoin, but BCH was transferred to this wallet and even after checking the block explorer and seeing that there were 50 confirmations, still no log of the transfer even after 7 hours. People in the U.S. need to keep track of this for tax purposes but it's not too reliable. I'm not sure about all of the coins but LTC is another one that should be examined. Thanks.","Works well keeping in mind its Binance on the Binance blockchains. It does Ethereum Mainnet as well, but will not allow DEX between blockchains. Also will not allow swap between blockchains. So if you have ETH or USDT and want BTC (or visa versa) this will not work for you. Otherwise it is a nice wallet that pays interest on a few held assets (mostly BNB).","It would be the perfect wallet if it had more Binance Smart Chain coin swap options. Dapp browser conflicts with Android Web View sometimes causing loading of exchanges to slow down immensely. Support for ease of access to exchanges is incredible and top quality. In App Price chart is slow to reflect real-time value and tends to lag behind the real time value of coins 9/10 times. In App buy minimum to fund the wallet is painfully high most times. Suggest sending funds to wallet from elsewhere","So far My experience using the trust wallet app has been very good I must admit.... BUT, BUT, BUT your continuous habit of deleting users transaction history/ID everytime the app is updated is a big FAILURE , y'all really need to find a solution to this issue... There isn't any backup feature which allows TX history/ID to be saved & this can be a big issue for many users from different parts of the globe.... As a early user of TW having access to my TX history/ID is very important .... Pls Fix","I was initially a little upset with Trust Wallet because of some issues I was having, but they have great customer service! Now that I know how to fully use the app, it is very easy and I like it. Edit: I lowered my review to 3 stars. I have used a lot of crypto apps and this is definitely the most difficult one to use.

Plz confirm it and get my offers in their original positions please....","Take much time on one trade,another fast option should be initiated,i think it like auto option,one person want to sell and fix the rate for sell,should be his name and bank account mention on trade page. Buyer just see and send money to his account, and escrow release the currncy. Why the chat option is initiated when the person want to sell,just wastage of time, Should be fast,your prosses is very slow and disappouting.","Edit: got scammed (didn't follow guides- lesson learned). The app lets you pay someone, then cancel the trade without seller confirming they've refunded :\\ Used in-app reporting, but nothing happened. Later learned you have to raise a support ticket to quickly sort disputes. However, support was great once they were on it, and won the dispute pretty quickly. There's a slightly frustrating learning curve, and UI can be a bit clunky, but once you find how to get help they're good.

Its interface is easy to use. Great for beginners. I hope they add more coins in the future. Watch out when using the exchange. They won't return your tokens after cancellation. Beware.","Simple, clean, and source available. Beware, though. They claim only the minimum blockchain fees are assessed but the build distributed here charges multiple doge, sometimes tens or even hundreds, when Dogecoin famously only requires 1 doge for even large transactions. Where are these extra doge going? Are they going somewhere or are users simply forced to overpay? No option to edit fee. Strangely, it seems honest and correct for other coins. I use the langerhans wallet for Dogecoin anyway but it's frustrating because I'd like to recommend this one for general multi-coin use.","Says it converts DOGE, then doesn't let you. Transferred crypto over to it and now wasted a fee to do that and going to get charged for going somewhere else. This is a waste of your time, find another app, another site, anywhere that you can that will let you convert what you want to. Seems pretty dodgy to advertise something and then not do anything that you've said. The app is easy enough to use, and that's the only reason for not giving a 1, simple and basic, nothing to say there, but definitely not worth your time for trading.","Great app just having trouble getting a old account back as I don't know of the log in","Charged me a $10 fee for buying $30 of Bitcoin, then only alaws me to send half of what I put in.

I gave it 4 stars because it is not completely perfect to use and navigate, transaction history does not reflect all the transactions made by me whether it is sending or receiving coins and I wish the notifications of this app is working or is it just me because I am using an older version of android 8. I hope you can fix this and overall it is a good app not great.","This has got to be the worst crypto wallet I've ever used. Tons of bugs and glitches, complicated staking procedures, and the fees are very high. On top of that I lost coins due to a problem with the wallet and customer service is simply incapable of understanding my problem or helping. My advice would be to stay away from this app.","Works well for me and I do recommend. Sometimes it takes a little time for transactions to go through but this is true for most transactions of this type. One thing to makes sure is you keep enough etherum to pay for the transaction if that is what is used for the fees. So just don't zero it out is what I am saying.","Great app for a beginner, such as myself. More up and coming coins need to be added. The ability to sell and trade coins directly thru the wallet would make it the best on the market. And if you really want to solidify #1 spot, bring the community of AWC users together like they've done on my favorite trading platform.","Great app, easy to use. So many nice features. Could use some added features. It's hard to know what your total returns on investments is since it doesn't keep track of where you stared. Haven't had great success in identifying if I've made anything on my staking crypto either.

The integrated blog is well written and gives useful updates on the app and general news relevant to investors. Easy read. I recommend this to cryptocurrency beginners especially. I found Luno from their ads around London and am now applying for a job with them!","Luno is a good, reliable, and efficient application. The only things I'm not happy about is that i get charged for almost every transaction I make(no matter how small), and I was hoping that a Demo account system could be implemented for the exchange. I would really appreciate it if there was also Ripple(XRP) Saving wallets. Please please please add an XRP savings wallet","been observed for 2 month for this app.the system have some cheating algorithm when you buy and sell from luno. e.g when you buying btc, the rate is expensive RM142,828 and when you quickly want to sell btc, at same time,same second(without price market change significantly at all) rate become cheaper, which is RM142,135.i have tested back n forth for many time with constant market rate, still same/not close. dont try to order me contact support or what bcoz nothing to report, this is cheating.","Usage has been smooth for some months now, until recently... I lost my device and got a new one. All efforts to login with my details have been ineffective. I mean, you guys have my email address and phone number, why so difficult to redeem my account when I have assets in there?","I love this app, it is to easy to use and user friendly.

Maybe they are just 'busy' but it's been two weeks since I submitted my ticket and I still haven't conversed with a human! Ergo, one star because the app installs. Nothing more as my BTC are still yet to be found since I 'smart' transferred them in. I would avoid this app at the present time based solely on the support experience. [edit] Support ticket#333616 has been responded to - thank you - +1 more star. [edit#2] - you mention refund but the ticket says the partner has all the info and to create a new PAYIN BTC. All very confusing. We will see. [edit#3]. They eventually refunded me, however based on this experience I still cannot recommend nor give > 2 stars - especially when they ask me to edit the review. If I had enough funds I would transfer what little BTC I have elsewhere and close the account.","For the most part I like the app alot. I transferred in out and exchanged numerous times with no problems. It's always worked smoothly before.....I sent 14.9 xrp \"with the correct tag number included\" ......and never recieved the xrp. I submitted a ticket. Waited. Then got an email saying they are backed up on tickets and are trashing all existing open tickets and to submit a new one. I did. It's been a week since I submitted the new one. Costumer Service at freewallet is a joke.","ticket ID is 315537 Update: The customer service officially provided me the things i needed to submit. And i sent their requirements, hopefully i got to access my account, finally. *Ratings may change depends on their response. Update: They fix my problem.

And why? I've never seen another app exchange ever have these issues. The date and time that was requested for payout or exchange should be honored. It was offered to the users as functional, and hasn't been the case on your end as promised.. These excuses are not acceptable. Compensation seems appropriate for start.","Apparently, the WORST app ever. Been trying to sign up since forever. I've re-installed the app severally.

Haven't done my transaction yet but I hope it will do well. I can custom transaction fee myself and keep it as low as 1satoshi/byte. Mycelium Wallet also allows this feature however this wallet seems more handy.","A great wallet that handles a wide variety of coins. Yet to have a single glitch. Works great on my Android tablet. Heartily Recommend.","Overall. Great! Only 2 small issues since having the app and now on my desktop. I couldn't do 5 ‚≠ê because the app and desktop are usually never synced together. The app shows one amount and PC a totally different amount even if I was to sync them at the exact time. That's probably my biggest issue. Other than that an awesome and secured wallet. Oh and it would be nice for the tokens to be updated and not have to manually put them in. That's all...","The pin security doesn't work! I lock my screen, unlock and the app is still open. What's the point in even having a pin set if you don't all for it?","I tried 20+ wallet and this is the best one.

My money is in my original which I still can't get them to give me any way to access it. Bottom line ...don't trust them with your money! I have talked to others that have the same problem. Don't trust Abra!","Nothing special about its features. The interest earning options require a KYC application with Prime Trust. My application was pending for over 2 months with no explanation. My repeated attempts to get more information resulted in automated, bot generated emails, and no action. ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE customer service!!! At least I was able to take my BTC out.","They are saying that it's wallet has it's own unique recovery phrase, but when I login in my recovery phrase I can't recover my account anymore, my investment was gone. I did my verification of identity but it stuck me, there's no way to proceed. hoping they will improve their system. I've lost my 300 Canadian dollars. it was.","Why does it all me to update my app all the time when there is no update available? They claim no fees but they get you on the spread. Comes out close to what Coinbase charges, only CB is transparent about it. I've had the app for 3 days but got a message today saying I had to update it to use it. So I go to update it. There's no update available. You can't do limit orders.","Multiple attempts over the past four months to verify KYC proved futile, even when app confirms successful completion of verification process. All requests for assistance through Abra's customer service yield no results in rectifying the issue. Not only does it take customer service, in average, three weeks to respond to inquiries, but their response is always the same; to follow the app step by step guide to complete KYC verification."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.plutus.wallet","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.plutus.wallet&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Mobile Bitcoin Wallet","description":"Qcan - Bitcoin as easy as your number\r\n\r\nSend, receive and store bitcoin privately, worldwide with a Qcan mobile Bitcoin wallet.\r\n\r\nSuper Easy\r\nFinally a mobile Bitcoin wallet easy enough for anyone to use.\r\n\r\nPrivate & Secure\r\nNo personal information.

Worst experience ever!!! Account terminated without letting you know what are the reasons. I just used coins.ph for transferring and sending money then they terminated claiming that I am no longer using coin.ph as it is supposed to!!!! Then why do this app lets you to use buy and sell of crypto(BTC, ETH, XRP) ??? So wrong in so many WAYS !!! Disappointed, not recommended, not for crypto user, not for money transferring, you'll never know when they will ban you!!!","They really have a great customer service. As long as you provided your concern in full detail and provided the necessary requirements, they'll be able to fix it in a just a couple of days. So happy I got my payment right away! As what stated in their instructions, it might take for about 20 days. But I got my money back to my verified account in just a day! Kudos to your email support team! I'm really thankful!","It' s been my 2nd time to encounter this delay on Instapay ( should be real time) during the time you need the fund the most. Now for the 3rd time, hoping that they've improved the Instapay but not. Still not a reliable app when it comes to the cash out or Instapay. They always charge you for Instapay but the process worst than Pesonet. Do not transact INSTAPAY on this app you'll just be charge of 10 pesos for an inconvenience fee. It's not real time crediting then just blame the receiving end.","The id verification is stupid. Evnethough you pass a clear picture of your ID. They will not accept it. They won't accept it unless its really scanned with scanner. Been having this same problem for weeks now and in multiple devices and accounts. It really gives us users the impression if you really do check our submitted ID pictures or just lazy to check properly.","The app is quite good but the system is not properly designed to handle huge transactions, despite having Cryptocurrency investment, so it's a let down. I have lost so much opportunity to invest more in crypto but it won't let me due to cash-in restrictions. Moreover, selling Cryptocurrency is also a cash-in transaction so that makes it more cumbersome. Applying for custom limit is also no good. They'll probably let you if you're that damn rich."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"asia.coins.mobile","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=asia.coins.mobile&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Bitcoin Wallet - Blockchain Explorer","description":"Bitcoin Wallet - Blockchain Explorer is the cold wallet, it is the safest, and open source, for send and receive Bitcoin.\r\nBitcoin Wallet is decentralized and peer-to-peer.

In this update:<br>- Bug fixes &amp; improvements","comments":["I really enjoy the app! I use the card for purchases I would make like gas and snack food because you get a little CRO back so I thought why not. Buying coins is easy as well. The only part I don't really understand is the card tiers say you need a minimum staked in dollars to go up a tier, but then when I go to stake there is a minimum written in CRO or whatever other coin I've tried staking. Other than that I really enjoy the app and if you're wanting a debit card for crypto, this one works!","App is not incredibly intuitive, but it's still pretty solid. Only 3 stars because app doesn't work at all in newest version of Android beta, which is currently preventing me from accessing my investments. Reduced another star (now 2) as it's not been a month since the Android 12 beta went public and has even had an update, but this app has still not been fixed. It's the only app that I've encountered that does not work in the beta.","I purchased crypto worth $3,520. I was showing this amount but when the transaction complete I was charged a fee even though it did not show the box where I have to check it and agree to the fee. I contact customer service many times but no luck I told them it was a glitch on their end but the customer service is like a robot.. they just copy and paste.. total scam I do not recommend it. I am in a process to cancel my account.","This is the most complicated app I've ever dealt with for crypto buying selling and tracking. It's takes forever, selling and trading is extremely confusing. Only reason I am using it is ability to buy diverse coins. 1 star is very harsh, but its obvious this app is designed for the educated when it comes to crypto, people new to crypto currency would be better served going somewhere else. Trading, buying, or transferring needs to be made more simple .","Overall the app is nice, that is if you get to open it! I've been using it for 6m now and would like to see faster replies from the customer service agents and limit orders when buying coins. Ah, I didn't get my referral credit too. A bit more generous rewards for staking would be appreciated too. Other than that, it has a nice selection of coins and it's quite easy to use."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"co.mona.android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.mona.android&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"BTC.com - Bitcoin Wallet","description":"The leading multi-platform Bitcoin & Bitcoin Cash wallet.\r\n\r\nBuy, store and use bitcoin in a simple and secure way.

It would be great if you could click on an offer & read the complete offer details with more info about the apps. There's lots of task apps I'm unfamiliar with or never heard of. I do like the app. I've cashed out 3x without a problem. I've found games/apps I enjoy & play regularly. Excellent ncentive program. Tons of tasks to choose from, easy & quick to earn.","Not worth the time or energy, stay away from this app. Offers will \"magically\" expire just before you complete them. This happened to me multiple times on tasks that take 15 to 20 days to complete. Not to mention you would probably earn more money in the same amount of time spent by picking change up off the street. Also would like to mention that every task offered is designed purposefully to get you to spend money. You will be hit by a time wall, or a pay wall every time Support will not help","Play a couple games get bitcoin that easy. It took me about 3 days to get enough to cash in so not a second job but its nice to see coin in my wallet I did not pay for. After playing one of the harder tasks for more credits upon completing task no reward. Will update review as it progresses","I completed 24,000 points worth of rewards and still have yet to receive them and it's been 4 days. I emailed support after about 24 hours and have yet to hear back why the delay. UPDATE: It's been 7 days since I competed the above task and reached out to customer support.

I really wanted to give 5 stars but the app failed to update after a recent transaction stating that I am offline. I found that I had to clear cache then restart, for it to work properly. Therefore only 4 stars for now. EDIT: after trying the built-in exchange I have removed another star from my review. Like others described before me the fees are higher than expected. DO NOT use the exchange service.","Easy to use, high transaction fees (but that's the bitcoin miner fee, it's the same no matter what wallet is used), only thing keeping it from being 5 stars is the fact that the minimum for exchanging altcoims is 52 euro which is quite high (as in, if I want to convert BTC to etherium, I have to convert a minimum of 52 euro worth) but overall a good, safe, easy to use app.","Wallet fees are ridiculous. Total Wallet amounts sometimes freeze so you have to reload multiple times for aggregate dollar amounts to show correctly. Ain't nobody got time for that foolishness. Update 5/5/2021: Based on feedback from Jaxx I will adjust my overall rating from 2 stars to 3 stars. If Jaxx can improve the crypto aggregate so that it's more reliable I will adjust my rating again. Thank you for your feedback. That piece of information you shared is helpful for my understanding.","Not good for new users. I tried to move and then trade around $400 USD of crypto coins and it says there is not enough money to do the transaction. The money is stuck there. This apparently this is nothing to do the makers of the wallet but they could have given some indication this was the case. I am new the crypto but I has no idea it costs more than $400 to move coins to another wallet or to an exchange.

Best crypto widgets (come with the app). The only feature I wish for would be a year long chart widget. I know this sounds unnecessary because yesterday's year-long chart will be similar to today's and tomorrow's, and because many people have a mental image of the last year. However, for myself, it's easy to forget exactly when things happened 8 or 9 months ago, & that's important for seasonal trends. I can look it up, & just remember, but I end up w/ a static image in mind.","An amazing app for both news and keeping up with crypto prices. The choice of alarm settings are great and the widgets that come along with the app are useful too. Highly advise buying the pro version. You get what you pay for with it.","I mainly use the app for the widgets on my homescreen, to get a quick look. This used to work like a charm. Now the widgets don't update anymore for like a week already. Fix this and you'll get 5 stars.","The (less than<) function for the alarms I set stopped working. Only notified for the (greater than >) ones. Emailed company twice with no response or fix. I see another person had this issue also. Was working fine until a month ago.","Advised that the wallet will cease to exist soon, recommended to move my funds. I can't withdraw the funds using the same card that I bought the Bitcoin with because it's a Visa, but I also cannot transfer the currency because my total doesn't meet the minimum transfer amount.

This scam app is easy to recieve the cripto, but very hard to get It back or make any payments over it due to the hidden minimum amount which you can see only before the last step and which is way more then the purchase amount.

To convert your coins you must have ¬£50-¬£60 worth them which is absurd. To transfer coins the fees extortionate. They say there is no hidden fees etc and its Tx fees but you can send crypto from wallets like Coinbase, Nash & Blockchain without fees that high. I'd recommend any new users to fully avoid CoinPayments unless you want a large %of your crypto gone","I can't access acct. There is no option other then scan qr. This is a joke. .36 short and I'm being strong armed $5 in \"fees\" to make up the amount needed bc btc price went up. So not fair. You guys have it setup so no support is available.

Email reset won't send. App is up to date. No response other than an automated email saying there was a problem and to update. Concerned my account was compromised and whomever is having all the time in the world to steal my money and identity. AT BEST Voyager has stolen $100 plus dollars from me. DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE Once again I have to file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau.","Super easy to use. Nice to be able to fund asap unlike a lot of other exchanges or custodians. Entry to the crypto space is great. Following areas of improvement: the \"Slide/Swipe\" to buy is a bit weird as I'd prefer something like a button with less motion. The app could be made more snappier. Scrolling left/right to holdings performance is a bit weird. But aside from all that, I'm a fan of the product and business model. THE INTEREST IS JUST AWESOME üòé.","Be ready to pay a premium. You will always buy at the ask price and sell at the bid price. The difference on the app is 2-5%. So potentially u will lose 5% when you buy and when you sell. Most good exchanges the difference is way less than .05%... Here you are in the hole 10% by the time you cash out. Crypto withdrawal fees are highest in business as well.. over $40 for some tokens, compared to $2-4 for others. That said the app is very easy to use and UI is great. Worth it?- you decide","#SHIBARMY ALL THE WAY! Thanks for listing! Update: After posting my review I read others and I am confused with the latest comments. I've used Voyager for about a month and a half and it has been nothing but a great app. I have never experienced any lag on transferring fiat to and from the app. Never any issues with buying or converting crypto; no issues what so ever. Don't know what they mean, Voyager is one of the easiest apps to invest in crypto.","Started off okay. Not sure about the fees but my issue is that I can't log in or change my password due to \"internal server issues\". This has been going on for weeks now.

Unfortunately I don't believe this is the crypto app for me, mostly because the minimum is $100 and that's just way more than I'm willing to spend, although that's more of a person finance issue and not their fault, it's just a shame. Other than that, I would say the biggest (CON) for me is the app will say oops error and I have to close and reopen, in order to go back to where I was.","I tried this because CoinMama recommended it. But this app is 1. Expensive- 15% service fees 2. Wasteful- BTC withdrawal uses 1 sender, not a pool, so you will lose a chunk of the coin you bought at a premium. 3. My only card purchase took a day to be credited, RIDICULOUS I will just use CoinMama desktop site. Or CashApp. You will be happier.","The app is hands-down one of the best out there in terms of UI and usability. Downside is it needs my FACE ‚Äîthe very thing I'm avoiding, to process everything. Can't believe who's gonna see my face after I take a picture. üò¨ Edit: they said my data is stored locally. PS: Are you sure that backing up my crypto data on GOOGLE, of all things, a really smart idea? I can't overlook this part.","I am not a trader and was a bit apprehensive when a vendor wanted payment in BTC. I found ZenGo to be the most efficient means to this end. I can now confidently say that it is easy to use and will continue using it. What's more, the virtual assistance provided I found to be exceptional.","I have been investing in crypto for a couple years, but when coinbase restricted me I knew it was time to get a wallet.

Constantly falling behind the network as peers can not be found or are found for just a few seconds before being dropped. This causes transactions to be stuck for several hours.

Coinomi is a far better choice. Syncing took ages, was unreliable, and sending was even less reliable. 4 blockchain refreshes didn't fix transactions not being broadcast, despite being fully synced.

Paying with the Bitcoin Wallet from BitBucks is both simple and innovative:\r\n\r\nSimply pay with bitcoin to the phone number of a friend or scan the QR code of a participating merchant ‚Äì and all within seconds. With BitBucks, long waiting times of Blockchain transactions become a matter of the past. As fast as the Lightning Network  and yet far more user-friendly!\r\n\r\nEven if the payee does not have the BitBucks wallet yet, the bitcoin payment will be made instantly and added to the account after registration. That‚Äôs how easy mobile payments with bitcoin can be on your smartphone. Due to it‚Äôs simple interface and easy handling, BitBucks is even suitable for the stationary Retail!\r\n\r\n\r\nKey features of BitBucks include:\r\n\r\n* Payments with Bitcoin instantly to phone numbers\r\n\r\n* Bitcoin Payments in Retail\r\n\r\n* Payments in all currencies\r\n\r\n* Simple and secure payments from everywhere\r\n\r\n* Send bitcoins to friends and local businesses\r\n\r\n* Make payments without high fees\r\n\r\n\r\nWe at BitBucks are intensively dealing with the future of crypto currencies and in this context are providing a solution which integrates Bitcoin into everyday life. We strongly believe that payments are the key to achieve this goal!\r\n\r\n\r\nIn just three simple steps you can pay (almost) everything with bitcoin:\r\n\r\nStep 1: Get the mobile payment app BitBucks Wallet from the App Store\r\n\r\nStep 2: Top-up your BitBucks account by sending BTC to your Bitcoin wallet address\r\n\r\nStep 3: Simply pay with bitcoin to phone numbers of friends or merchants\r\n\r\n\r\nBITCOIN - MONEY OF THE INTERNET \r\n\r\nBitcoins true purpose is for payments - this is what we at BitBucks are convinced of. However to maintain it's key properties of being a highly secure censorship-resistant payment system - a decentralized settlement network - Bitcoin needs the Blockchain. \r\n\r\nDespite all its advantages in terms of security and decentralization, the Blockchain does not intrinsically make Bitcoin an adequate means of payment.\r\n\r\nREGISTRATION\r\n\r\nThis is where BitBucks comes in! The Bitcoin Wallet enables instant payments with bitcoin. Users register at BitBucks just by entering their phone numbers followed by a validation code sended to them via sms.\r\n\r\nAfterwards users can top-up their BitBucks account with bitcoin by using any other Bitcoin wallet. Every transaction within the BitBucks app, as well as the top-up of the account, are free of charge. \r\n\r\nSECURITY & PRIVACY\r\n\r\nBitBucks facilitates the storage and exchange of bitcoins, as any wallet does. All bitcoins within BitBucks are stored on multi-signature addresses. Vaults securely store the keys, and to gain access additional custodians are required.\r\n\r\nPAYMENTS\r\n\r\nBitBucks supports nealry every monetary system arount the world and that's why payments within the Bitcoin Wallet are calculated in any selected currency.\r\n\r\nWe are keen on adapting Bitcoin into everyday life.

Or register/sign up attempt is more like it. I received an error each attempt. The verification email link failed and I was told to try again. 3 more attempts still without verified email. My logic: they cannot even process a simple registration with the app so how safe will my assets be with them? I really did want to give it a chance, however I just do not enjoy throwing money away. Uninstalled!","I made my account and transferred in my coins. My advanced verification was pending and then I got an email saying that my account was going to be terminated with no specific reason why. Reaching out to support only got me the same vague reply that they had a reason to close my account but not what reason. Luckily, I was able to remove my coins but I can't ever use Nexo again.","So far it's good. Interest rates are quite competitive and having a lot of options is nice: earn in kind/Nexo, hold Nexo loyalty levels, and a higher locked monthly rate. Have not withdrew yet but reviews say it should be ok, faster than Blockfi at least (but KYC is required for reasonable amounts). Daily compounded interest vs weekly/monthly. App is ok. Text is not clear/scaling issues. GUI is confusing as you're not sure what can be tapped (almost everything can be). Web app is good though.","Worthless app Really cloud flare recaptcha inside the app!? How a company with so much money isn't able to deliver a ok user experience?! Beside user experience I tried at least 10 times to pass basic verification but it just doesn't work. And don't bother fixing this useless app already moved on to another one.","Great platform.

It a great way to keep a general idea of what's going on without having to sit down with my spreadsheets. Unfortunately it doesn't update well and the open trades from most exchanges won't show up. If they do, it's only for BTC. Love this app, don't get me wrong. It's just needs some improvement and I cannot wait for it. (Paid user)","Overall great app and easy to use. But there is a bug in the Custom Alert when you edit the notes in what Coin and save it, the notes from other Coin appears to a different Coin. So I have to refresh it or go to a different tab then switch back to make it look how it should be. I also hope to have an option to add a device since I use two devices to keep track the whole day. There is also some needs for improvement when updating the main, and including graphs in the widget.","I used the free version for a couple of days, and felt like the pro would have some edge. Boy, how wrong was I, it's fantastic! You can connect it to all your wallets, exchanges, websites, etc. And have a holistic view of detailed one on your cryptos and portfolio. Now I can easily know, where I'm losing or making money. I highly recommend this app. Worth every penny, especially if you consider the competition that offers less of more money.","Really great app! I like the ability to get a complete view of my portfolios without having to go to each individual exchange app. The daily (customizable time) report is really cool too! I've been using it for around 4 months now without any issues. I highly recommend CoinStats!!! üëç","My sister likes this app so I thought I'd try it. She has an Apple phone & her app alerts settings offers a sound option so she uses \"Choo choo\" sound to not miss any alerts. I have a Samsung Note 20 Ulltra but the app doesn't offer any sound options. We're both using free option so far. Does anyone know why? 3 stars because of this but I'll update if resolved."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.coinstats.crypto.portfolio","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coinstats.crypto.portfolio&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Wirex Card & Multicurrency Crypto Wallet","description":"Save money with a banking alternative that gives you total control over your money.

However, there is an annoying announcement / ad banner at start of the app every time which can only be closed with the cross button situated at the top corner of the screen. Due to the large screen phones today, closing this banner requires a two hand manoeuvre which is really poor design according to me and is also annoying to be receiving the banner in the first place. Banners should be placed in a manner that is non-obtrusive and secondly user should be able.","Awesome. It's good that many coins are added, but it's confusing. Showing different page per currency isn't comfortable. There must a single page of all coins available with current prices and even columns with what we hold of them. And then when we touch the respective coin we could see history and price chart while whatever we hold too should be shown at once and total price of what we hold too. There were no such monthly charges when i was using wazirx earlier. This rule has come later.","1. App user interface is not intuitive. 2. While doing KYC if you accidently go back, you will need to refill the info. 3. Also if KYC rejected, whole form needed to be refilled. 4. Not sure where can we see price timeline for coins. It is very important to showcase that at very main screeen. 5. While adding INR money, options provided are only mobikwik even though it shows UPI verified.","Great. Very easy to understand and invest in crypto using this App. Best app out there in market for investing in crypto. Easy to navigate and very easy to understand and you can see prices of crypto updating every second. Much impressed with this app and withdraws and deposits are very easy in this app. The charts for each individual token/coin load very slow and sometimes non responsive with no axes labels. One cannot see the trend over time on the app easily. Wish we had more data and notes.","Really, amazing! This app only has a big name else than that there is nothing about it. About a month ago I placed an order for a shoe. And I received a different product then what i had ordered for, so the very same day I requested for a exchange. Unlike other shopping site Wazirx had quiet a complicated exchange process where in we need to provide all if proof and stuff. But as asked by Wazirx I emailed them my Adhar card as an ID proof and later again I sent my passport because Wazirx said."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.wrx.wazirx","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wrx.wazirx&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Cryptonator cryptocurrency wallet","description":"Convenient & secure cryptocurrency wallet with over a million accounts since year 2014!\r\nCryptonator is an all-in-one cryptocurrency wallet which supports multiple cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC) and others.

I tried it at 2020 and it was all good at that time but now it is getting worse. They take 10 doge as a fee for transfer . Well as u can see 1 doge on other platforms. So as my experience this the worst app ever i have used . Its so worst that when i tried to transfer my dogecoin from cryptonator at the time when the fee was 1 doge it never happened. They failed my transfer every time and now they have just increase the doge fee.","Was working great at first but once dogecoin shot up it started having serious issues, it's been down for a month and tons of us are still waiting on a reply from you guys, your support isn't doing any supporting at all cause no one has gotten any answers, we're all left in the blind here, sooner or later you guys will have to answer for what you're doing.","Dogecoin went \"offline\" for two weeks, meaning you were unable to access your crypto, so no sending or trading. Completely ridiculous. 100% Scam Service. The value of the coin cut in half in that time. Cryptonator is NOT regulated and charges exorbitant fees. Use Binance or Coinbase instead.","I transferred my 23000 dogecoin in my another wallet in 19th May, but in my cryptonator transaction activity still showing my transaction in pending why? If system is pending from your side so please revert back my transaction. Last so many days I continues sent you reminder on your given mail id, but from your side no any response for me.

They did acknowledge receiving the money but did not find my account. I have been constantly emailing them looking for an answer but so far after several days, i have had no answer. Really slow and inefficient customer service . My money is apparently stuck now.","Good app,but has some disadvantages. When you want to sell crypto, app will sell it lower than actual market price. You loose. When you want to set a limit order, it gives you EUR currency, but I want to set in USD! Since I trade BTC/USD, not BTC/EUR! When you buy crypto, app buys it higher than standard market price, possible they create price gap + app takes big commission. Limit orders are very inconvenient and useless.","Would be better if it supported deposits and withdrawals with all the currencies it offers and not just 4 or 5, but the fees for sending/withdrawing bitcoin are a total rob so I don't know if I'd even use it. Sent out ‚Ç¨40 worth of bitcoin and got charged ‚Ç¨8. That's 20%. Besides that, it's a decent lite trading app.","The app has so many bugs I have to reinstall it basically every day. The most recent one is that I cannot get past the enter pass code screen. To gain access I have to delete the app and then install a fresh one.","The app is very unstable.

It has been well over a month that the transaction is pending !!! This is not acceptable ! I tried contacting the support on multiple occasions and they are useless ! I am paying them monthly for \"premium priority service \" and it definitely doesn't feel like it. As soon as i get the money (if i ever do) i am probably going to cancel the acc","The app is great, but unfortunately talking to the customer support reps in charge of reviewing customer documentation is an abysmal experience. They appear to be working off a list of standardized questions which they keep repeating over and over, like a chatbot, in spite of having been provided with the requested documents. When asked for clarifications they seem unable to answer, and resort to repeating the standardized questions all over. Unfortunately this renders the service unusable.","Love it, easy to use interface and very quick sending and receiving money. Trading is awesome but more company's need to be listed, there's a massive amount missing compared to other apps. Crypto is nice but the fees are quite high for trading at 2-2.5%(you basically need a minimum of a 5% gain to actually make any profit). Still though, excellent app, highly recommend and I'm not normally one to actually post a review!","App is as bad as their customer service Sadly their app doesn't allow access until submitting revised document yet again. Chat option to \"speak\" to anyone is never available. I can't even close the account as it has a positive balance but can't chat with anyone to get that balance back in order to close the account!!! So if you want a Bank where you can't access the app and your money AND can't speak to anyone about your account then this is for you!!","Seriously considering switching to Monzo. I used to be one of Revolut's biggest fans and advocates (:' and would try and convince all my friends to use it. However the app has got steadily less usable and more convoluted and irritating. Every time a useful feature would disappear (and a useless pushy one seemed to take its place), I would assume the developers would realise their mistake and rectify it with the next update...

Can't recommend this exchange for people looking to trade","Everything was great, at first. However, the last 3 days that I've been on has been a nightmare! The service will freeze up (Android, iPhone, website) and it has caused me to liquidate 3 times now!

This single key serves as the root of the tree. The generated mnemonic sentence or word seed is simply a more human-readable way of expressing the key used as the root, as it can be algorithmically converted into the root private key. Those words, in that order, will always generate exactly the same root key. A word phrase could consist of 24 words like: begin friend black earth beauty praise pride refuse horror believe relief gospel end destroy champion build better awesome. That single root key is not replacing all other private keys, but rather is being used to generate them. All the addresses still have different private keys, but they can all be restored by that single root key. The private keys to every address it has and will ever give out can be recalculated given the root key. That root key, in turn, can be recalculated by feeding in the word seed.

If the wallet was not previously used it will be empty.\r\n\r\nNon-deterministic wallet\r\n\r\nIn a non-deterministic wallet, each key is randomly generated on its own accord, and they are not seeded from a common key.

One improvement I suggest is to improve the user experience with syncing, since it takes a long time. If you could show progress more closely instead of updating only every few hundred blocks that would be good. Or adding an estimated time until completion might also be good.","Used to work fine on my Android phone. But XMR won't sync anymore or connect to any nodes, all show red.
