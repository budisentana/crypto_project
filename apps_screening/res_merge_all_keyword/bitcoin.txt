Half a year later, I feel a need to update this review but unfortunately I can't give more than 5 stars. In the beginning I screwed up two times with my fiat fundings. I thought I lost that money, but when I reached out to Kraken support they fixed it in less than two days. Very friendly and patient employees 💎✨👑","One thing I really miss is a little indicator next to my coins that shows the change in their value as a percentage compared to my initial investment (ex. +3,6% compared to when I bought the coin). Honestly, I don't understand how is this not a feature already, literally every other crypto and stock exchange has this. Otherwise it's great so far.","I'm genuinely shocked at how basic this app is. It's meant to be one of the most established exchanges, but the functionality of this app is way behind any others I've used. There's no ability to search, and cryptos aren't listed alphabetically, so it's difficult to find anything. No price alerts either. I can only assume a browser based version is far better.","This app requires me to remove and register my bank constantly. Advice from support was to just keep reconnecting it. But I am limited to 5 bank connects within a 30 day period. Great advice... 😑. Something todo with a timeout from my bank. Well, yeah you don't keep the connection open unless you are buying. If it's trustly's error then switch to plaid Gemini works just fine, no issues whats so ever. If Gemini added Cardano to their platform.

In this update:<br>- Bug fixes &amp; improvements","comments":["I really enjoy the app! I use the card for purchases I would make like gas and snack food because you get a little CRO back so I thought why not. Buying coins is easy as well. The only part I don't really understand is the card tiers say you need a minimum staked in dollars to go up a tier, but then when I go to stake there is a minimum written in CRO or whatever other coin I've tried staking. Other than that I really enjoy the app and if you're wanting a debit card for crypto, this one works!","App is not incredibly intuitive, but it's still pretty solid. Only 3 stars because app doesn't work at all in newest version of Android beta, which is currently preventing me from accessing my investments. Reduced another star (now 2) as it's not been a month since the Android 12 beta went public and has even had an update, but this app has still not been fixed. It's the only app that I've encountered that does not work in the beta.","I purchased crypto worth $3,520. I was showing this amount but when the transaction complete I was charged a fee even though it did not show the box where I have to check it and agree to the fee. I contact customer service many times but no luck I told them it was a glitch on their end but the customer service is like a robot.. they just copy and paste.. total scam I do not recommend it. I am in a process to cancel my account.","This is the most complicated app I've ever dealt with for crypto buying selling and tracking. It's takes forever, selling and trading is extremely confusing. Only reason I am using it is ability to buy diverse coins. 1 star is very harsh, but its obvious this app is designed for the educated when it comes to crypto, people new to crypto currency would be better served going somewhere else. Trading, buying, or transferring needs to be made more simple .","Overall the app is nice, that is if you get to open it! I've been using it for 6m now and would like to see faster replies from the customer service agents and limit orders when buying coins. Ah, I didn't get my referral credit too. A bit more generous rewards for staking would be appreciated too. Other than that, it has a nice selection of coins and it's quite easy to use."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"co.mona.android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.mona.android&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Bitcoin Wallet - Blockchain Explorer","description":"Bitcoin Wallet - Blockchain Explorer is the cold wallet, it is the safest, and open source, for send and receive Bitcoin.\r\nBitcoin Wallet is decentralized and peer-to-peer.

I've installed several of the Bling games and the point system is tied together, so all of them work towards one big pool of points. So far, I've cashed out 4 or 5 times and I've gotten it in my coinbase wallet within day (ish). The games are also fun, and unlike some games I haven't noticed any diminished points after you play awhile.","Okay what happened? At first it was okay, it rewards more or less than 3000 coins but greater than 1000 but now, it rewards 500 plus but less than 1000. I watched your advertisements ads in hopes that it would increase no it didnt. The prices in bitcoin at this writing is negative so it was not that reason. So what happened?","App does what it states but that's about it. Payouts are small, really small. To be honest, you are best walking around the streets looking for money because you will get more that way then all you need to do is buy Bitcoin instead of wasting your time playing these apps. The ads you watch give these Devs alot more than what they give us.","The development is really good and they're legit but the game is a bit difficult somehow.","I enjoyed using this app but now all the sudden it won't open at all? What do I do to get it working again? \" Update\", had to end up deleting the app and re-downloading it. Works great now.

I think they need to make it more clear that those arrows on the side are the send and receive buttons. I think they should also display your balance first before they show the price of the cryptocurrency. What I mean is that instead of having to switch to see your balance I think you should have to switch to see the price of what ever cryptocurrency you are on. Other than those two things the app is amazing! 😄👏🏼","This wallet is all we need. More and more coins are added and the best part is that this wallet is user friendly. I highly suggest to use their desktop wallet for best experience. Their support is also superb. I can still remember when I had some issues with my deposits way back in 2017, they were helpful and very professional. Keep it up exodus, cheers!","Slider shows wrong value when you are at 6 months scope - how can be peak of a price graph be 30 while the dip is 50? I do remember when I bought but it is about money it really shouldn't show wrong values. Nice design. I would like to see auto note about price when I did recive or send. And my average - just a lil bit of analytics. ( any price graph has this bug - it is more apparent with scope 1+ month)","The app is indeed very convenient; its design is well suited for everyday crypto needs, however the problem on my phone (which is running Android 8.1) is that the app requires more CPU and RAM resources than the phone is okay dealing with, which results in a significant delay when loading the UI screen for each requested functionality; in short - it's slow. Other than that it's a great tool to have. For legit advice on acquiring Bitcoin with zero investment see cb.run/earn-bitcoin-free","Exodus is by far the best wallet when it comes to UI/UX. Although, it lacks some more advanced features; which keeps it from being my main wallet.

In this update:<br>🔧 Bug fixes and improvements","comments":["So here's my thoughts on this app, first is that this game is really fun and enjoyable even though u have ads to watch but still it's enjoyable, the next one is it's so easy to earn the coins here and one thing that i love is they still give coins even if u weren't able to finish the level. And lastly, is it pays!!! Though the amount is not that big, but still it payss!! U just need to have PATIENCE!! Anywaysss I had fun playing this game, i almost forgot i can earn in this app..","Really great. Finally I've got my first cash out. Thanks bitcoin pop. But the problem is too slow and you need to watch one ads every level of the game then you need to wait until 6 days come for the next cash out. But it's all good. And i will recommend this to those who needs bitcoins.","Game is legit. You do get paid. Only downside is the long ads. Once you master the game, you'll spend more time watching ads than playing it.","This game doesn't deserve a single star. I was satisfied with little earning but it is not acceptable to not give cash out. It's almost one month I cashed out 10000 sitoshis still I didn't receive it I tried to contact the game developers but they didn't reply so I recommend to not install this game. Highly disappointed total time waste.","This company (Bling Financial) is one of the few that actually pay out! You win the reward whether you win or lose, and although it is not much of a payout (little pieces of Bitcoin) it is still a payout. I very much enjoy these games as they are a lot of fun, and I have played most if not all of their apps."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.bling.bitcoinpop","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bling.bitcoinpop&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Cointiply - Earn Free Bitcoin","description":"It's easy to start earning with Cointiply! \r\n\r\nOver 20 ways to earn free Bitcoin.\r\n\r\n* Collect free daily Coins from our faucet.\r\n* Redeem free promo codes.\r\n* Paid out more than $1,000,000 to our users.\r\n* Complete daily surveys.\r\n* Play fun games.\r\n* Watch short videos.\r\n* View Paid to Click ads (PTC Ads).\r\n* Chat with other crypto currency enthusiasts and earn while you chat.\r\n* Frequent bonus days, coin boosts & giveaways.\r\n* Loyalty bonuses up to 2x the rewards.\r\n* Withdraw your Coins to your Bitcoin wallet, or Doge Coin wallet.\r\n* And much more!\r\n\r\nCointiply has been a trusted source for earning free Bitcoin & Doge Coin for over two years.

I like that I can pass the time and generate passive income. I haven't tried to withdraw yet, but only because it says you can earn 5% if you have over 35k in coin. Sounds good to me. I will only change this rating if it for some reason doesn't allow me to withdraw my earned btc. Anyway, enjoying the app and happy to make some dough. Thanks Cointiply!","At first it was very good. Playtime was brilliant. I hardly change the device because the other one had a problem. This was said on both devices at once: this is not compatible with my device. 5 minutes before there were no problems. Even after I reset the cache and the GAID, it is not possible the support just says that my phone is not compatible. 5 minutes before everything works, you are simply fobbed off, and that after 4-5 days until you get an answer in support gets a shame. And i see it coming an standard answer here who says plz reset the GAID and Cache -.- or plz contact our support (that what i have done before i make the review.","This is one of the better sites to make a few dollars. They pay very well (relatively) to play their app games. I admit the games are just boring luck based ones, but still, they pay pretty well. The hourly roll for free coin is more data intensive than other apps and the capcha is a bit of a pain, but it's free. I also like the idea that they pay interest if you have 35k coin balance. I've made about $10 in coin in two weeks.","Great site, I just wish the surveys were more available to get. *edit: Thanks for the response :D another great reason to like this site!. I was just getting a lot of sad face emojis & \"this survey isn't for you\" Everything else seems so well balanced and even entertaining, keep up the great work!","This WAS a great app until the survey issues (see previous review) but hey, the games were working great until about 10 minutes ago when I took a break and now can't play them anymore due to \"device not supported\". Are you kidding me?? I was literally JUST playing without any issues!!! Fix this problem ASAP so I can get back to earning!!

Then for some reason sometime within the last month the exchange has gotten really bad. Both PC and mobile app. Disconnecting every 30 secs or whenever there is a spike or dump, coincidentally. The exchange takes forever to load up, if it ever does, so I'm constantly closing and restarting to try and fix it. Can't recommend this exchange for people looking to trade","Everything was great, at first. However, the last 3 days that I've been on has been a nightmare! The service will freeze up (Android, iPhone, website) and it has caused me to liquidate 3 times now!

I've reached out again and was told that my ticket would hopefully get expedited soon. That was a week ago. I don't think anyone is trying to help me.","Liked the app until I saw you can't withdrawal money very easy at all. The minimum is high to be able to transfer. I feel like that's how people steal people's money. I hate putting bad reviews. I'm going to change it once you've changed that. If I put my money anywhere I shouldn't have to withdrawal 200 just to get my money out.

Or it can just stop out of no way. And you guys never attend to your clients even if they drop comments or complain to the support email. You didn't even put your residential address.

Stay tuned for the big update!","comments":["It's a beautiful app. Setup is gorgeous. Functions are extremely helpful. It a great way to keep a general idea of what's going on without having to sit down with my spreadsheets. Unfortunately it doesn't update well and the open trades from most exchanges won't show up. If they do, it's only for BTC. Love this app, don't get me wrong. It's just needs some improvement and I cannot wait for it. (Paid user)","Overall great app and easy to use. But there is a bug in the Custom Alert when you edit the notes in what Coin and save it, the notes from other Coin appears to a different Coin. So I have to refresh it or go to a different tab then switch back to make it look how it should be. I also hope to have an option to add a device since I use two devices to keep track the whole day. There is also some needs for improvement when updating the main, and including graphs in the widget.","I used the free version for a couple of days, and felt like the pro would have some edge. Boy, how wrong was I, it's fantastic! You can connect it to all your wallets, exchanges, websites, etc. And have a holistic view of detailed one on your cryptos and portfolio. Now I can easily know, where I'm losing or making money. I highly recommend this app. Worth every penny, especially if you consider the competition that offers less of more money.","Really great app! I like the ability to get a complete view of my portfolios without having to go to each individual exchange app. The daily (customizable time) report is really cool too! I've been using it for around 4 months now without any issues. I highly recommend CoinStats!!! 👍","My sister likes this app so I thought I'd try it. She has an Apple phone & her app alerts settings offers a sound option so she uses \"Choo choo\" sound to not miss any alerts. I have a Samsung Note 20 Ulltra but the app doesn't offer any sound options. We're both using free option so far. Does anyone know why? 3 stars because of this but I'll update if resolved."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.coinstats.crypto.portfolio","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coinstats.crypto.portfolio&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Bitcoin Wallet Blockchain","description":"Bitcoin Wallet is the cold wallet, it is the safest, and open source, for send and receive Bitcoin.\r\nBitcoin Wallet is decentralized and peer-to-peer.

Worst app i have ever seen. What should i do by contact support there is a automated reply by bot, redirecting me on a page to tell me how to verify phone. That is really idiotic thing bg paxful. You need to fix the issue at you app and website.","Its a really good platform for trade ,But suddenly my offers went to unresponsive list bottom of the list which means they are not in their position and i raised alot of tickets contact support dont have proper answer for that they saying our system have new ranking procedure but evn i have more thn 100 positive feedbacks without any single negative one how can my offers went down in unresponsive or unactive list?? Plz confirm it and get my offers in their original positions please....","Take much time on one trade,another fast option should be initiated,i think it like auto option,one person want to sell and fix the rate for sell,should be his name and bank account mention on trade page. Buyer just see and send money to his account, and escrow release the currncy. Why the chat option is initiated when the person want to sell,just wastage of time, Should be fast,your prosses is very slow and disappouting.","Edit: got scammed (didn't follow guides- lesson learned). The app lets you pay someone, then cancel the trade without seller confirming they've refunded :\\ Used in-app reporting, but nothing happened. Later learned you have to raise a support ticket to quickly sort disputes. However, support was great once they were on it, and won the dispute pretty quickly. There's a slightly frustrating learning curve, and UI can be a bit clunky, but once you find how to get help they're good.

However recently, I've noticed some of the ads are becoming extremely intrusive. Though this is probably the vendors fault rather than the devs. But frequently I get ads lasting 30 seconds, you're forced to open google play then you have to go back to the game and wait another 5 seconds. It could be classed as malware as the ads open an app without consent. May want to look into it with the vendor.","My tickets never get included in the prize draws. I keep collecting thousands of them and they never get spent. It's really frustrating seeing that timer always go down, but my tickets are unaffected. Pretty good game appart from that. Hence the actual second star.","Well it is good, but need some improvements. There is sometimes a bug after watching ads, just get stucked and need to restart game.

The RSI alerts only trigger for BTC and ETH, multiple times when it stays under 30. All other RSI alerts for other coins aren't being triggered at all. If I don't find why it's not working by tonight, it's bye bye from my phone.","Multiple alerts. Why does this app send me a notification a dozen or more times over and over and over. Once a notification is sent, there should be a delay before sending further notifications in case bitcoin is teetering on the edge of an increase/decrease. Very very annoying to get dozens of notifications within moments of one another... Edit : here's hoping it's fixed","A piece of garbage, never send any alerts, u try to run query it only show few same thing in two day, this must be thrown out of play store, i don know but may be it made by a fool. Thx and regard","Fantastic. Does exactly what it says it does and with a very nice interface. Good options for setting alerts and graph displays. Cheat sheet is a nice addition too. The only thing I could hope for in future upgrades would be ability to add widgets. Well done.","Gorgeous looking app. Hats off to the developers. Ready to use alert functions too and would love to see user selectable alert or ring tones to make the alert feature fabulous. Looking forward to delving deeper into this app but from what I have seen so far, hight praise to the developers."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.cryptoprice.titan","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cryptoprice.titan&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Voyager - Buy Bitcoin & Crypto","description":"Voyager: The simple and secure way to purchase 60+ cryptocurrencies while earning up to 10% interest (APR) on your portfolio. \r\n\r\nVoyager carries the widest selection of altcoins in North America, all within a regulated and secure investment platform.

Email reset won't send. App is up to date. No response other than an automated email saying there was a problem and to update. Concerned my account was compromised and whomever is having all the time in the world to steal my money and identity. AT BEST Voyager has stolen $100 plus dollars from me. DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE Once again I have to file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau.","Super easy to use. Nice to be able to fund asap unlike a lot of other exchanges or custodians. Entry to the crypto space is great. Following areas of improvement: the \"Slide/Swipe\" to buy is a bit weird as I'd prefer something like a button with less motion. The app could be made more snappier. Scrolling left/right to holdings performance is a bit weird. But aside from all that, I'm a fan of the product and business model. THE INTEREST IS JUST AWESOME 😎.","Be ready to pay a premium. You will always buy at the ask price and sell at the bid price. The difference on the app is 2-5%. So potentially u will lose 5% when you buy and when you sell. Most good exchanges the difference is way less than .05%... Here you are in the hole 10% by the time you cash out. Crypto withdrawal fees are highest in business as well.. over $40 for some tokens, compared to $2-4 for others. That said the app is very easy to use and UI is great. Worth it?- you decide","#SHIBARMY ALL THE WAY! Thanks for listing! Update: After posting my review I read others and I am confused with the latest comments. I've used Voyager for about a month and a half and it has been nothing but a great app. I have never experienced any lag on transferring fiat to and from the app. Never any issues with buying or converting crypto; no issues what so ever. Don't know what they mean, Voyager is one of the easiest apps to invest in crypto.","Started off okay. Not sure about the fees but my issue is that I can't log in or change my password due to \"internal server issues\". This has been going on for weeks now.

This game really deserves a good rating because it is honestly one of the best games out there.","It's a simple game. Now i do have something to say. In the starter realm, you have the default skin.so when you travel to another realm, you can make a new skin, and when traveling back to the starter realm, you have the default skin while on another realm, you have a fancy skin If you could do that in the next update, it would be nice Keep up the good work!","Yeah, this game is pretty fun. Just not very appropriate for children. There are some subtle adult jokes hidden throughout the game. However, if you arent offended by any of that, this game would be great to play. No bugs I've found in the few days I've played it already. Overall a fairly great little mobile game :)","This could have been fun. It sadly becomes a dopamine overload very quickly. Working on giving you hits every few seconds with something else you've 'unlocked' and/or 1000x more money (locked behind you watching a scam game's trailer for a minute) The scaling on the game also becomes a chore and becomes seriously unfair as it goes on, the trick is the developers have made the game addictive as possible to start with, then start suggesting you pay a lot of money to continue to enjoy it.","₿est ₿it¢oin ¢li¢ker game I know. If you like The Sims 2, you will like this even more! It's a little mini-gamish..but besides that, it's very enjoyable alone. It feels a lot better than AdCap and it's more modern.

The exchange and withdrawal fees are outrageous. You will get better returns on your PC if you invest same amount.","Wasted my money on this one, when you take into consideration the electrical fee, and the withdraw fee, it would take over 100 days of mining to withdraw 0 dollars, and without the withdraw fee, it already takes over a year to recoup the money it takes to get the rate. Basically, it will take you maybe 2 years, to break even in your dollar value assume coin price stays the same. Just buy coin or get your own miner.","I've been with hashiny for a little over 2 years and have stuck it out. The electricity fees are high but support is quick to respond and assured that it will change for the better. That's the only issue I've had so hopefully it will. Then I'll give 5 stars!","Been mining with them for about 6 months now. Electric fees are to high and withdrawal fees are even higher. When you are able to withdraw at .1 you are able to withdraw 0.0000 token...wish I would have used a different app but for now im stuck for 2 years probably more to profit...lower fees and lower electricity fee and I will definitely give 5+ stars because the app itself is well organized and easy to use and navigate.

They claim only the minimum blockchain fees are assessed but the build distributed here charges multiple doge, sometimes tens or even hundreds, when Dogecoin famously only requires 1 doge for even large transactions. Where are these extra doge going? Are they going somewhere or are users simply forced to overpay? No option to edit fee. Strangely, it seems honest and correct for other coins.

Leave a review if you’re enjoying the improvements.","comments":["It was decent to use but the lack of backing up your info apart from having to manually record a 12word recovery phrase is so annoying and needs to be addressed in this modern day where everything is stored on our phones. Edit: I know that it's secure - too secure! My office got broken into and all my paperwork destroyed. Making excuses oppose to listening to those who use your app is just poor customer service and am now reducing my rating to 1 because of that.","My experience has been so good, i felt i needed to write a review for others who need a good wallet and cant decide based on others feedback. The app is so user friendly. Is very easy on the eyes. Is super quick. Ive downloaded close to 15 other wallet apps and with BRD i transferred in some BCH (bitcoin cash) the transfers were lightening speed. Literally in split seconds. And network fees $0.00. Wallet fees? $0.00. Yes it cost me absolutely nothing to send BCH in split seconds. I love it 5/5.","I tested this app when it first came out some years ago. Back then it was by far one of the best wallets available and it still is! Security is strong and it has a host of useful features such as the ability to import encrypted private keys from paper wallets you may have cold storage. It also allows you to sweep both BTC and bitcoin cash from wallets created pra to any forks. Don't be put off by some of the negative reviews, if you read them you will find most of them are unreasonable.","Pretty good app for the most part but sometimes you will get an error message when trying to trade between cryptos and it only give a error code and does not tell you what went wrong. Most of the ti.e it is because the app doesn't want you to transfer all of your coin to another coin. For ie. If I have $500 in BTC and want to put that all into ETH I will get an error code. Now if I leave $20 in my BTC and transfer the rest it works pretty good. Buy BRD coin you will save money in trading coin.","Horrible app for your crypto wallet. As soon as my last few transactions clear I am uninstalling. I have been using this app for over a year now and it has literally got worse over time. Transactions take forever for no reason. Overcharge for everything. Trust me...find another wallet.

Used to be good. Then they removed nano, which made sense at the time because of the spam attack. Then it got fixed but nano never returned. You can now ONLY withdraw bitcoin and it's worth like one third the amount you used to get. The \"latest updates\" you see on the google play page is false advertising, front and center. Don't know why they get away with it. Cherry on top - the support team has called it quits.","Used to be good, now insanely low rewards and forces you to pay the BTC miner fees, so you get next to nothing after a ton of work.","Pretty good app, at least it used to be before the pointless (pun intended) update where the points earned no longer go towards Nano currency. Now it's only super inflated Bitcoin where earnings are so low that you couldn't afford even a can of beans after what you would make in a month's time. Not too happy but devs use this comment and take it as a learning experience. Fix your app. You will have my patience and kindness.","Not bad for the type of app it is. Avoid Pollfish surveys as they will lead you through a full length survey then not reward anything. InBrain surveys are hit or miss whether they reward anything at all leading them to be a time sink. Theorem Reach surveys will typically award at least something. The other app related opportunities pretty much don't reward anything. Update: seems all the surveys are now done by Lucid, which requires a lot of unnecessary cookies allowing them to track too much.","3 stars - I've had a lot of fun in the past year with this app, I've made over 50$ btc in my free time playing games, just make sure whichever offer wall you use has a customer support section. When points don't come through you have to email the offer wall for customer service. You also have to email Quicrypto customer service if you need to change your wallet address [annoying, but they are nice and helpful] these days the app is glitchy and good offers are hard to find.

I believe they use the players phone in order to mine crypto currency for them selves.

I can't even find the doubled arrow shown here in the game itself in order to exchange it to real money.

They advertise that bitcoin can be earn from playing but there is no bitcoin to be earn. There are tons of ads and i can't transfer to another phone when i change phone.

Sometimes it takes a little time for transactions to go through but this is true for most transactions of this type.

However, there is an annoying announcement / ad banner at start of the app every time which can only be closed with the cross button situated at the top corner of the screen. Due to the large screen phones today, closing this banner requires a two hand manoeuvre which is really poor design according to me and is also annoying to be receiving the banner in the first place. Banners should be placed in a manner that is non-obtrusive and secondly user should be able.","Awesome. It's good that many coins are added, but it's confusing. Showing different page per currency isn't comfortable. There must a single page of all coins available with current prices and even columns with what we hold of them. And then when we touch the respective coin we could see history and price chart while whatever we hold too should be shown at once and total price of what we hold too. There were no such monthly charges when i was using wazirx earlier. This rule has come later.","1. App user interface is not intuitive. 2. While doing KYC if you accidently go back, you will need to refill the info. 3. Also if KYC rejected, whole form needed to be refilled. 4. Not sure where can we see price timeline for coins. It is very important to showcase that at very main screeen. 5. While adding INR money, options provided are only mobikwik even though it shows UPI verified.","Great. Very easy to understand and invest in crypto using this App. Best app out there in market for investing in crypto. Easy to navigate and very easy to understand and you can see prices of crypto updating every second. Much impressed with this app and withdraws and deposits are very easy in this app. The charts for each individual token/coin load very slow and sometimes non responsive with no axes labels. One cannot see the trend over time on the app easily. Wish we had more data and notes.","Really, amazing! This app only has a big name else than that there is nothing about it.

I created an account went through the tutorial and it gave 2000 acf pts. Gave me a button to click on it Said \"Register now.\" Big bright yellow box. The button said to \"COMPLETE\" my registration in order to save my progress. I clicked it and it sent me through the tutorial again. Once completed it said it was deducting my acf points for detecting fraud from opening more than 1 account and then stripped me of all the coins. Now the only way I can get more than is real $$$..What a JOK","Cool concept but poor execution. I am a crypto fan boy and I really wanna like this game but it can't keep my attention as it doesn't seem to have a flow to the game. Even with the tutorial and an understanding of crypto exchange interfaces I cannot seem to find meaningful things to do.","Updating my review. Thanks to Tom for reinstating my account. Now that I'm actually able to play, i can say this app is fun and informative. The contests are good and some are categorized and only allow those cryptos (in order for you to learn what each crypto is used for ie. Privacy coins, currency coins). For the simulation part, it is great. It has basically all the features and options a real exchange would have. The price changes are delayed though. I enjoyed the margin trading too","I've been using this app for over a year. It's good practice, it's fun and if you place well enough in the contests they ACTUALLY pay you. Also, the support team answers and solves issues you might have in a timely fashion. If I had the money I would totally pay to be a gold member, although, I feel like I should be grand-fathered in just because I've been a loyal patron for so long. Maybe they will consider???","The app is a great way to still participate on the go. One thing to improve: the buy/sell pages - it is hard to slide the amount to buy or sell when you can switch tabs by swiping. Using a slider on a swipeable tab is not easy to use if you want to for example sell all your current coins. I suggest using the same methodology of the website by adding the 25, 50, 75, 100 percentages to choose. Apart from this, app is fast and never has given me any problems."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.altcoinfantasy.altcoinfantasy","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.altcoinfantasy.altcoinfantasy&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"CoinDeal - Bitcoin Buy & Sell","description":"CoinDeal is the best place to buy, sell and manage your cryptocurrency portfolio.\r\n\r\nWe are one of the most powerful exchange platforms, offering over 50 markets, including the most popular cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum, Bitcoin or Litecoin, but also 7 FIAT currencies.

Only problems I have is the farm repair. It's a great idea but it's extremely hard to do it. You try to pick this part but instead you pick the part that's already in the right place, annoying especially with small parts. Could be fixed by making the parts in the right place locked. The lab is also extremely laggy (didn't have this problem until a while ago), farm repair is impossible in that. Also, if we pay 100k to get a farm repair, we shouldn't have to do it ourselves.","Love the concept. I just wish there were more areas to explore. Like add a couple more maps, places and quests. Also adding a x10, x20, x50 or x 100 button to the upgrades would be much more suitable timewise. Instead of click, click click. Kind of annoying.","A very descriptive and innovating game,you just need to get the hand of the game flow to make the most of it.

You can constantly compare yourself to other traders. You see your profit compared to theirs which is very fun and encouraging.","Lost so much money with this app. Price is going up? won't let you buy. Price is crashing? Won't let you sell. Does this every single time I try to buy or sell. When I do manage to get a buy in the price coincidentally starts crashing and the app glitches out and won't let me sell. Also, and most annoyingly, the app constantly logs me out in the middle of a price drop.","This is an incredible application I like it so much... hope it had devices to do the examination (like to draw the obstruction and backing ) things like however generally speaking it's amazing.","So far have been trying the application with a virtual record and I have thought that it was simple.

The short logon time during inactivity might be a problem for me, It requires you to have all your ducks in line before you start changing anything. Overall I think it really deserves and should retain the five star rating.","I’ve been using Bitcoin Cryptonaire since it offered only the BTC/ETH/LTC. It’s great that they’ve expanded and I never thought there would be a app but I’m glad there is. The only issue I have is I have a lot of smaller change in some coins that I cannot exchange. Maybe if there’s a feature like Binance to exchange small funds into a certain coin.","Hey, thanks for the consistent updates. I do have one request that I’m sure quite a few other people are interested in though. So, currently in the charts within Bitcoin Cryptonaire you can only hold 1 finger and move it along the chart to see the price based on where your 1 finger is touching the chart, but a 2 finger touch on the charts used for determining price changes within a specified range defined by the distance between the two fingers touching the chart would be very useful. This functionality is available in the default/native stock app, and the Robinhood app, and quite a few others. Hopefully I explained the 2 finger price chart functionality in a way that is understandable. Either way, thanks. Have a good one!","Haven't had a problem. Bitcoins get bought & Immediately are available for purchase. Have not had a problem paying for goods.

I would give it 5 stars but the graph data is almost always wrong. Sometimes it's off just a bit and other times it's off a lot. Like today, graphs shown next to each coin show a sharp, temporary dip but when you go into that coin to view the graph, it does not show that dip.","This app couldn't be better. One thing that I love about this app is that it doesn't require you to log in or sign up as I'm using it only to check the prices of some coins that I have purchased from a different app. The widget is lovely and the numbers are clear and I love its ability to give notifications once a coin reaches a certain amount. Removing the ads is worth your two dollars. All in all, PERFECT! 👏","This is the best functionality of all the ones I've tried, however, it is a bit buggy. Sometimes the coins on the widget disappear and you have to hit refresh. Not a big deal but it does happen. Also, sometimes when I click on a coin in the widget and it opens in the app, it opens to the last thing I was looking at and not that coin. I'd be happy to work with support.","Everything is great, I also bought the ad free pro version. Just one BIG downside in widget, I'm not able to find any option for auto refresh (pro versions in few crypto apps do offer a feature where widget prices refresh automatically within the time interval you select). I know it can affect battery life, but i hope you can offer an upgrade with that feature with user having a choice to keep it off, or select auto refresh intervals like 2, 5, 10 mins, etc. Else it was 5 star for me","Ads are too frequent unless you pay. I had to edit as the developers think we are slow and don't understand the obvious. Devs - we know you want money and don't care about the people who use your software for free, but this is where your customer base comes from.

If Bitcoin performed positively within the given time span, it is colored in green. Otherwise it is colored in red. Further intervals allow you to examine the price action more closely. The displayed price for an interval is the average price of all exchanges for that moment. Its relative change compared to the price 24 hours ago gives you an understanding of the trend and volatility of the market.\r\n\r\n☆ Cross Coin Check\r\nOur Cross Coin Check gives you a broad insight into market developments and allows you to compare Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Litecoin (LTC) and IOTA (MIOTA) among each other. For this purpose, we continuously calculate all the prices and calculate the relation to each other. It is important for us to emphasize that the prices are obtained directly and unaltered by the exchanges! That means, our exchange rates are not manipulated (yes, we're hinting at 'Coinmarketcap').\r\n\r\n☆ Trade Signals\r\nOur purely AI driven trade signals provide you with up-to-date trade recommendations.

If Bitcoin performed positively within the given time span, it is colored in green. Otherwise it is colored in red. Further intervals allow you to examine the price action more closely. The displayed price for an interval is the average price of all exchanges for that moment. Its relative change compared to the price 24 hours ago gives you an understanding of the trend and volatility of the market.<br><br>☆ Cross Coin Check<br>Our Cross Coin Check gives you a broad insight into market developments and allows you to compare Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Litecoin (LTC) and IOTA (MIOTA) among each other. For this purpose, we continuously calculate all the prices and calculate the relation to each other. It is important for us to emphasize that the prices are obtained directly and unaltered by the exchanges! That means, our exchange rates are not manipulated (yes, we&#39;re hinting at &#39;Coinmarketcap&#39;).<br><br>☆ Trade Signals<br>Our purely AI driven trade signals provide you with up-to-date trade recommendations. You can use these recommendations (strong sell, sell, neutral, buy, strong buy) to support your buy, sell or HODL decisions.<br><br>The current prices for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Litecoin, XLM, EOS, DASH and IOTA are obtained directly from the exchanges and are not altered like on Coinmarketcap. This means that you get live tickers from exchanges like Kraken, Binance, Coinbase, Coinbase Pro, Poloniex, OKEX, HitBTC, Bitpanda, Bitfinex, Bitstamp and Coinfinity.<br><br>With our free crypto apps you&#39;re well equipped to make the right buying or selling decision of Bitcoin and Altcoins!","summary":"Get trade signals and technical data to support your buy / HODL decisions","installs":"50,000+","minInstalls":50000,"maxInstalls":89292,"score":4.223301,"scoreText":"4.2","ratings":970,"reviews":330,"histogram":{"1":113,"2":9,"3":75,"4":122,"5":649},"price":0,"free":true,"currency":"USD","priceText":"Free","offersIAP":false,"size":"6.6M","androidVersion":"4.4","androidVersionText":"4.4 and up","developer":"David Pertiller","developerId":"8921992343140454441","developerEmail":"support@bitcoinmonitor.app","developerWebsite":"https://bitcoinmonitor.app","developerAddress":"Baumeistergasse 88A / Parz. 4\n1160 Wien\nÖsterreich","privacyPolicy":"https://bitcoinmonitor.app/imprint","developerInternalID":"8921992343140454441","genre":"Finance","genreId":"FINANCE","icon":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/EwUrxqcKH3Q7V4CPBI1E2LE6Mn3sqvThrGRRsIiP9rS3pjz7QlKdOpFgaBy3XNJHKw","headerImage":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/bCodPnak3My92y_IucYLIOCOkpJYtCxaCCA2-cRBz4cgXzT1yeokOVNNiCFZq_JVhw","screenshots":["https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/B_9BHL0IMM4LuTxy8msSFA3Yc2-M21kG5KtLbgKU6HTbVOClKPbEMexWgAvlZ3Cc5w","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/TmEQLCSp4j74Ht2whhwSLlYroifOgJ5JyuZ8Daiw0i0myl11kFiuURCVMkIcHygu6j8","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/MGMdfQgqd-fDseUzgiVMyXFwZ1A4Diq4l64RWSCNRfurtYYchBUMtMvqjCmRkudvyEo","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/9EDRcKGeWPPn5PlamqIIgMkNEwzVLeUn8VM1OUt7zQ1bn9-t83BiUWlsQBGv3REuHw","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/qaN8dQ26jCrrG1jeNcRqtBxrHaU9XL8ijOp5UgNtYnjdT3kYfVN_Ary4Xl6LdRYwrA","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/92hHR-4f-oH6C1SFHobYSSFNAPIy24UfYCY4DCSC4ehBnmFwN2z9vQlqblxbR-tJaec","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/qvupWVhh2wKQ_xBh64wnZEJ8DpHKhnECefliKmouP2C8d1QELJ4DYyU3KA_PHN8xdVk","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/y9bvDZOiI50-5TatwUk_7vJHTzIoF_4umF9M5cOjlUYZqs8lD6O6nvbuhfhWV0Z_psuh","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/3XQ1yS0e-ny97tbj33iDd8SOnc5MtWSUzy-KYrhBPnS-0bdqYqoSQbXLY4bLRpyN5g0","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Zr9CZNGjN8yYgkiDEVD6_8YQ3pLFF2Sxb2rMKPrg2Lvoamh_GUb3qYooBt5K6-z50JQ","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/ltTApinopOnDssmwCe_IVJvOhmv3aEtW-8dQQKRSf4Khl5m59FFBthyGLVPe2g2pbkY","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/DoKbGeHZHtFqoAjBubLBj-utRX5SFRPYDCOpFGcB6iVYKp-E336c85j9-lS1pVkwp6c","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/MZm187xn-_-FZUBwP0H4EmS6BaIRu9mF5zSqhCxe0wAG7w0DA-oId-PsMeeFdVZhzpA"],"contentRating":"Everyone","adSupported":true,"released":"Jan 6, 2018","updated":1625462402000,"version":"4.000.0","recentChanges":"You can now toggle between relative and absolute numbers in the change &amp; volatility monitor","comments":["Works everytime like a charm.

This ledger of past transactions is called the block chain as it is a chain of blocks. The blockchain serves to confirm transactions to the rest of the network as having taken place. Bitcoin nodes use the blockchain to distinguish legitimate Bitcoin transactions from attempts to re-spend coins that have already been spent elsewhere.\r\n\r\nMining is intentionally designed to be resource-intensive and difficult so that the number of blocks found each day by miners remains steady. Individual blocks must contain a proof of work to be considered valid. This proof of work is verified by other Bitcoin nodes each time they receive a block. Bitcoin uses the hashcash proof-of-work function.\r\n\r\nThe primary purpose of mining is to set the history of transactions in a way that is computationally impractical to modify by any one entity. By downloading and verifying the blockchain, bitcoin nodes are able to reach consensus about the ordering of events in bitcoin.\r\n\r\nMining is also the mechanism used to introduce Bitcoins into the system: Miners are paid any transaction fees as well as a \"subsidy\" of newly created coins. This both serves the purpose of disseminating new coins in a decentralized manner as well as motivating people to provide security for the system.\r\n\r\nBitcoin mining is so called because it resembles the mining of other commodities: it requires exertion and it slowly makes new units available to anybody who wishes to take part. An important difference is that the supply does not depend on the amount of mining. In general changing total miner hashpower does not change how many bitcoins are created over the long term.\r\n\r\nDifficulty\r\nThe Computationally-Difficult Problem\r\nMining a block is difficult because the SHA-256 hash of a block's header must be lower than or equal to the target in order for the block to be accepted by the network. This problem can be simplified for explanation purposes: The hash of a block must start with a certain number of zeros. The probability of calculating a hash that starts with many zeros is very low, therefore many attempts must be made. In order to generate a new hash each round, a nonce is incremented. See Proof of work for more information.\r\n\r\nThe Difficulty Metric\r\nThe difficulty is the measure of how difficult it is to find a new block compared to the easiest it can ever be. The rate is recalculated every 2,016 blocks to a value such that the previous 2,016 blocks would have been generated in exactly one fortnight (two weeks) had everyone been mining at this difficulty. This is expected yield, on average, one block every ten minutes.\r\n\r\nAs more miners join, the rate of block creation increases. As the rate of block generation increases, the difficulty rises to compensate, which has a balancing of effect due to reducing the rate of block-creation. Any blocks released by malicious miners that do not meet the required difficulty target will simply be rejected by the other participants in the network.\r\n\r\nReward\r\nWhen a block is discovered, the discoverer may award themselves a certain number of bitcoins, which is agreed-upon by everyone in the network. Currently this bounty is 6.25 bitcoins; this value will halve every 210,000 blocks. See Controlled Currency Supply.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the miner is awarded the fees paid by users sending transactions. The fee is an incentive for the miner to include the transaction in their block. In the future, as the number of new bitcoins miners are allowed to create in each block dwindles, the fees will make up a much more important percentage of mining income.","descriptionHTML":"Mining is the process of adding transaction records to Bitcoin&#39;s public ledger of past transactions (and a &quot;mining rig&quot; is a colloquial metaphor for a single computer system that performs the necessary computations for &quot;mining&quot;.

I also can't save favourites, etc as the account creation uses the most ridiculous clothing descriptions based Captcha which I can't beat","The update has removed the 2 week chart and now displays the 24 hour chart with an hourly resolution.

After watching the ads for double bonus the game restarts itself again and let's me watch ads again and again. Even when I have a good WiFi connection after watching the ads it says network error and restart the game again rewards are reversed. The thing is I'm watching ads over again and again which is really annoying","Been playing for about 3 weeks moved up the ranks and what can i say. 1 game pays once a week in hora according to your rank and it will take couple months to get 10k hora worth of 0.6$ ;)). 2 game keeps disconecting from wifi after airdrops after watching boosts advertisement so it doesn't register and you don't get rewarded. Other than that it's a pretty simple game once you know how to progress fast but unless hora goes 1000-10000% in value your return will be close to nothing","Are you guys aware that some of your features are not working? I tried to press the ad button to speed up the research, but it wouldn't show an ad, even though it was lit up. Also, I'm not recieving the airdrops after watching the ads.

Dude I've scoured this horrid venue in search of what you're offering thank you! Honestly I'd hoped there would be more like this but unfortunately doesn't seem to be the case. Features I was seeking: first I needed the info as a persistent notification, the only app that offers this feature! Second the ability to create detailed alarms, yes there's a bunch of other apps that have this functionality but few that are sans adds. Plus open source... Sir I bow to you... 👏🪙👍❤️","I've tried many apps but this one is the best so far. 1. Very customizable you can almost customize anything in this app. 2. No ads no links no banners, just and free app with all the alarm exchange and crypto alerts settings. 3. Set your exchange select your currencies and set the alarms, make sure you allow it battery usage in background so it can keep track of the latest price so you don't have to open the app again and again. 3. Alarm Sounds are amazing , Good Job DEVS 👍 hands down.","Now, if one were able to see prices on the notification bar, right next to the Battery/WiFi symbols, that would be, well....
