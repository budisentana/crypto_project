I think they need to make it more clear that those arrows on the side are the send and receive buttons. I think they should also display your balance first before they show the price of the cryptocurrency. What I mean is that instead of having to switch to see your balance I think you should have to switch to see the price of what ever cryptocurrency you are on. Other than those two things the app is amazing! üòÑüëèüèº","This wallet is all we need. More and more coins are added and the best part is that this wallet is user friendly. I highly suggest to use their desktop wallet for best experience. Their support is also superb. I can still remember when I had some issues with my deposits way back in 2017, they were helpful and very professional. Keep it up exodus, cheers!","Slider shows wrong value when you are at 6 months scope - how can be peak of a price graph be 30 while the dip is 50? I do remember when I bought but it is about money it really shouldn't show wrong values. Nice design. I would like to see auto note about price when I did recive or send. And my average - just a lil bit of analytics. ( any price graph has this bug - it is more apparent with scope 1+ month)","The app is indeed very convenient; its design is well suited for everyday crypto needs, however the problem on my phone (which is running Android 8.1) is that the app requires more CPU and RAM resources than the phone is okay dealing with, which results in a significant delay when loading the UI screen for each requested functionality; in short - it's slow. Other than that it's a great tool to have. For legit advice on acquiring Bitcoin with zero investment see cb.run/earn-bitcoin-free","Exodus is by far the best wallet when it comes to UI/UX. Although, it lacks some more advanced features; which keeps it from being my main wallet.

Some coins do work, like Bitcoin, but BCH was transferred to this wallet and even after checking the block explorer and seeing that there were 50 confirmations, still no log of the transfer even after 7 hours. People in the U.S. need to keep track of this for tax purposes but it's not too reliable. I'm not sure about all of the coins but LTC is another one that should be examined. Thanks.","Works well keeping in mind its Binance on the Binance blockchains. It does Ethereum Mainnet as well, but will not allow DEX between blockchains. Also will not allow swap between blockchains. So if you have ETH or USDT and want BTC (or visa versa) this will not work for you. Otherwise it is a nice wallet that pays interest on a few held assets (mostly BNB).","It would be the perfect wallet if it had more Binance Smart Chain coin swap options. Dapp browser conflicts with Android Web View sometimes causing loading of exchanges to slow down immensely. Support for ease of access to exchanges is incredible and top quality. In App Price chart is slow to reflect real-time value and tends to lag behind the real time value of coins 9/10 times. In App buy minimum to fund the wallet is painfully high most times. Suggest sending funds to wallet from elsewhere","So far My experience using the trust wallet app has been very good I must admit.... BUT, BUT, BUT your continuous habit of deleting users transaction history/ID everytime the app is updated is a big FAILURE , y'all really need to find a solution to this issue... There isn't any backup feature which allows TX history/ID to be saved & this can be a big issue for many users from different parts of the globe.... As a early user of TW having access to my TX history/ID is very important .... Pls Fix","I was initially a little upset with Trust Wallet because of some issues I was having, but they have great customer service! Now that I know how to fully use the app, it is very easy and I like it. Edit: I lowered my review to 3 stars. I have used a lot of crypto apps and this is definitely the most difficult one to use.

In this update:<br>- Bug fixes &amp; improvements","comments":["I really enjoy the app! I use the card for purchases I would make like gas and snack food because you get a little CRO back so I thought why not. Buying coins is easy as well. The only part I don't really understand is the card tiers say you need a minimum staked in dollars to go up a tier, but then when I go to stake there is a minimum written in CRO or whatever other coin I've tried staking. Other than that I really enjoy the app and if you're wanting a debit card for crypto, this one works!","App is not incredibly intuitive, but it's still pretty solid. Only 3 stars because app doesn't work at all in newest version of Android beta, which is currently preventing me from accessing my investments. Reduced another star (now 2) as it's not been a month since the Android 12 beta went public and has even had an update, but this app has still not been fixed. It's the only app that I've encountered that does not work in the beta.","I purchased crypto worth $3,520. I was showing this amount but when the transaction complete I was charged a fee even though it did not show the box where I have to check it and agree to the fee. I contact customer service many times but no luck I told them it was a glitch on their end but the customer service is like a robot.. they just copy and paste.. total scam I do not recommend it. I am in a process to cancel my account.","This is the most complicated app I've ever dealt with for crypto buying selling and tracking. It's takes forever, selling and trading is extremely confusing. Only reason I am using it is ability to buy diverse coins. 1 star is very harsh, but its obvious this app is designed for the educated when it comes to crypto, people new to crypto currency would be better served going somewhere else. Trading, buying, or transferring needs to be made more simple .","Overall the app is nice, that is if you get to open it! I've been using it for 6m now and would like to see faster replies from the customer service agents and limit orders when buying coins. Ah, I didn't get my referral credit too. A bit more generous rewards for staking would be appreciated too. Other than that, it has a nice selection of coins and it's quite easy to use."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"co.mona.android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.mona.android&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Coinbase Wallet ‚Äî Crypto Wallet & DApp Browser","description":"Coinbase Wallet is the #1 mobile crypto wallet and Web 3 DApp browser.

I do wish that I could have a screen that would display what I have on coinbase inside of my wallet. I also wish that there was a way that you could convert USD coin or some other currency to another currency and pay the mining fee with the currency you are trying to convert with rather than pay with ethereum because you might not have any. And dark mode would be great. It's a good wallet so far.","I've been with Coinbase since 2017, and although the fees might be higher than other exchanges, it's very simple and smooth to use, and I never had any issues with this exchange. I earned free Crypto for simply watching videos, I earn interest on my Crypto, I can borrow, I can transfer easily, and my money is safe. Check out my website for $10 free in Bitcoin once you deposit $100.","This app is slowing down my phone. I have a Pixel 5 that doesn't have much on it. I keep it clean and don't install much. I am in cyber security and know it is not malware. Ever since I installed this app all other apps are painfully slow. I tried to force stop Coinbase Wallet and my phone's performance improved.

And why we have 2 apps, normal and pro. Just integrate both in one app and user should be able to choose the normal or pro layout just like other exchange.

Half a year later, I feel a need to update this review but unfortunately I can't give more than 5 stars. In the beginning I screwed up two times with my fiat fundings. I thought I lost that money, but when I reached out to Kraken support they fixed it in less than two days. Very friendly and patient employees üíé‚ú®üëë","One thing I really miss is a little indicator next to my coins that shows the change in their value as a percentage compared to my initial investment (ex. +3,6% compared to when I bought the coin). Honestly, I don't understand how is this not a feature already, literally every other crypto and stock exchange has this. Otherwise it's great so far.","I'm genuinely shocked at how basic this app is. It's meant to be one of the most established exchanges, but the functionality of this app is way behind any others I've used. There's no ability to search, and cryptos aren't listed alphabetically, so it's difficult to find anything. No price alerts either. I can only assume a browser based version is far better.","This app requires me to remove and register my bank constantly. Advice from support was to just keep reconnecting it. But I am limited to 5 bank connects within a 30 day period. Great advice... üòë. Something todo with a timeout from my bank. Well, yeah you don't keep the connection open unless you are buying. If it's trustly's error then switch to plaid Gemini works just fine, no issues whats so ever. If Gemini added Cardano to their platform.

When you buy crypto, app buys it higher than standard market price, possible they create price gap + app takes big commission.

Email reset won't send. App is up to date. No response other than an automated email saying there was a problem and to update. Concerned my account was compromised and whomever is having all the time in the world to steal my money and identity. AT BEST Voyager has stolen $100 plus dollars from me. DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE Once again I have to file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau.","Super easy to use. Nice to be able to fund asap unlike a lot of other exchanges or custodians. Entry to the crypto space is great. Following areas of improvement: the \"Slide/Swipe\" to buy is a bit weird as I'd prefer something like a button with less motion. The app could be made more snappier. Scrolling left/right to holdings performance is a bit weird. But aside from all that, I'm a fan of the product and business model. THE INTEREST IS JUST AWESOME üòé.","Be ready to pay a premium. You will always buy at the ask price and sell at the bid price. The difference on the app is 2-5%. So potentially u will lose 5% when you buy and when you sell. Most good exchanges the difference is way less than .05%... Here you are in the hole 10% by the time you cash out. Crypto withdrawal fees are highest in business as well.. over $40 for some tokens, compared to $2-4 for others. That said the app is very easy to use and UI is great. Worth it?- you decide","#SHIBARMY ALL THE WAY! Thanks for listing! Update: After posting my review I read others and I am confused with the latest comments. I've used Voyager for about a month and a half and it has been nothing but a great app. I have never experienced any lag on transferring fiat to and from the app. Never any issues with buying or converting crypto; no issues what so ever. Don't know what they mean, Voyager is one of the easiest apps to invest in crypto.","Started off okay. Not sure about the fees but my issue is that I can't log in or change my password due to \"internal server issues\". This has been going on for weeks now. Absolutely no access to my account and crypto.

If they do, it's only for BTC. Love this app, don't get me wrong. It's just needs some improvement and I cannot wait for it. (Paid user)","Overall great app and easy to use. But there is a bug in the Custom Alert when you edit the notes in what Coin and save it, the notes from other Coin appears to a different Coin. So I have to refresh it or go to a different tab then switch back to make it look how it should be. I also hope to have an option to add a device since I use two devices to keep track the whole day. There is also some needs for improvement when updating the main, and including graphs in the widget.","I used the free version for a couple of days, and felt like the pro would have some edge. Boy, how wrong was I, it's fantastic! You can connect it to all your wallets, exchanges, websites, etc. And have a holistic view of detailed one on your cryptos and portfolio.

All very confusing. We will see. [edit#3]. They eventually refunded me, however based on this experience I still cannot recommend nor give > 2 stars - especially when they ask me to edit the review.

Sometimes it takes a little time for transactions to go through but this is true for most transactions of this type. One thing to makes sure is you keep enough etherum to pay for the transaction if that is what is used for the fees. So just don't zero it out is what I am saying.","Great app for a beginner, such as myself. More up and coming coins need to be added. The ability to sell and trade coins directly thru the wallet would make it the best on the market. And if you really want to solidify #1 spot, bring the community of AWC users together like they've done on my favorite trading platform.","Great app, easy to use. So many nice features. Could use some added features. It's hard to know what your total returns on investments is since it doesn't keep track of where you stared. Haven't had great success in identifying if I've made anything on my staking crypto either.

My repeated attempts to get more information resulted in automated, bot generated emails, and no action. ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE customer service!!! At least I was able to take my BTC out.","They are saying that it's wallet has it's own unique recovery phrase, but when I login in my recovery phrase I can't recover my account anymore, my investment was gone. I did my verification of identity but it stuck me, there's no way to proceed. hoping they will improve their system. I've lost my 300 Canadian dollars. it was.","Why does it all me to update my app all the time when there is no update available? They claim no fees but they get you on the spread. Comes out close to what Coinbase charges, only CB is transparent about it. I've had the app for 3 days but got a message today saying I had to update it to use it. So I go to update it. There's no update available. You can't do limit orders.","Multiple attempts over the past four months to verify KYC proved futile, even when app confirms successful completion of verification process. All requests for assistance through Abra's customer service yield no results in rectifying the issue.

Seriously. Fix this app. Its miserable to use. App lags & then freezes after about 5 min of continuous use.

Disappointing and have switched to using the Fidelity app which provides the same features I was looking for without the ads. Just because the app is FREE doesn't justify full screen advertisements. There are plenty of free apps that are able to deliver advertising in a less obtrusive manner.","App seems ok but not used for long. Almost immediately after installing the app I had a cold call to my mobile and then received an email. Both from the company running the app. I'd only downloaded it to check the price and ask for an alert on some specific shares ( the only ones I own). Not impressed on how they exploited my contact details. I have uninstall the app.","Would be a more usefull tool if, when minimised, the app would stay in my minimised views section on my phone. It does not, it disappears as soon as I view anything else and, when I minimise that , to re-view investing app...the page has gone and I then have to go and re-start investing app and wait for yet another ad to load (which I, and almost everyone I know closes right away anyway) and then find what I was looking at before. In a trading situation, that is highly unfavourable. More work","Love the UI, push notifications are really meaningful, do not waste my time, the frequency is just right, helps quickly decide if I want to read the article in detail or just move on. Thanks to the Product, design and dev teams!","I think that this app is very useful. But, because my vision isn't what it used to be, I have my phone's font set as slightly larger than normal. This greatly affects the aesthetics of the app in a negative way. I made it smaller, so it could be beautiful, but it slightly strains my eyes to look at it.

I appreciate the app very much as it is very helpful to keep track of my crypto assets. Hopefully with the next update I can give it 5*.","The buttons are unresponsive, and there is a long lag time.

Awful user experience.","Be warned: They double charged me for one deposit. And they STILL have not fixed the problem for me 2 months later. They refer me to their financial company whom then gives me the run around. Eventually they said a refund was coming but it never came. They seem very unorganized at best, and possibly fraudulent at worst. I will not be depositing another dollar into this company. I do NOT recommend them to any new users.

Smaller spreads, they're pretty outrageous compared to the competition, like 212 2. Better charts - they're extremely slow to respond, the technical indicators are clunky, and you have to full-screen the graph to be able to manipulate it. Every other trading app does this better 3. The ability to set price alerts even if a stock is not on a watchlist. Just annoying really, especially since a watchlist is limited to 50 stocks","Great app, clean easy to use and very straight forward especially for beginners such as myself.. a few niggly things that annoy me are the monstrously big zoom in zoom out and share button that sits right in the middle of your charts. 1 more thing i would love the ATR tool to be added if anything else. Had great customer service with a few issues. Etoro has been in the game for a while and know what they're doing.","Poor app functionality. Outrageous spreads on most markets. Prone to crashing whenever volatility picks up. Inexplicable delays when withdrawing funds. And to top it all, APPALLING customer service (e.g. it takes them at least 14 days to even respond to a query). It is utterly beyond me how their app is so highly rated. My advice: avoid like THE PLAGUE.","Trading has never been easier when using etoro, you have access to a wide variety of products and services. The only problem I'm having is the withdrawal, I've submitted a withdrawal 13 days ago and even sent a problem ticket for customer service and still nothing. Provided them with bank statements that they were asking and now they are requesting a new one. Keep in mind they are requesting for another 13 day bank statement which cost me $1 per paper.

SoFi does not respond to emails at all, ever. It took a public Twitter message to get a response, and then they didn't even try to help me with it, just your pre-packaged \"we've forwarded the issue to our engineers!\" because that's ever true of any company. Unfortunately SoFi doesn't actually want your business, so better to go elsewhere.","I like having information on my cash, savings, credit, and investment accounts all in one place is nice. The tiles are a bit overwhelming at times though, something a little more minimalist and clean with a clear path to certain aspects of the app would be great. I occasionally feel lost when navigating through Relay and Money. The spending snapshot for relay is great, but I would like to be able to set spending budgets for each category in the future. Good app, great company.","I've done a few reviews on this app, but I felt the need to start fresh. This app is frustrating. They keep adding features, except those to to actually improve the app. There are no graphs to track your portfolio performance and you cannot do Stop loss orders or anything more advanced than a limit order. Also, the graphs on the stocks themselves rarely load. Just a spinning loading image. I'm continuously looking at other brokerages.","I actually really like this app, it's really user-friendly.

Cross-blockchain transactions are carried out using Atomic Swaps.</blockquote><br><blockquote><b>‚Ä¢ No additional fees:</b> You pay only a miner fee for both regular and cross-blockchain atomic swap transactions.</blockquote><br><blockquote><b>‚Ä¢ Stay incognito:</b> No registration or identity verification required because Atomex is a non-custodial cryptocurrency wallet.</blockquote><br><blockquote><b>‚Ä¢ Audited:</b> All blockchain atomic swap smart-contracts and crypto wallet core library audited by LeastAuthority.</blockquote><br><blockquote><b>‚Ä¢ Staking Tezos:</b> Delegate your Tezos (XTZ) to trusted bakers from the Baking Bad list and bring an income.</blockquote><br><h2><b>What is Atomic Swap exchange?</b></h2><br>Atomic swap is a technology for secure exchange of digital assets without the need to trust a third party. It‚Äôs as secure as cryptographic primitives and blockchain implementation it&#39;s based on. It&#39;s mathematically proved that in every scenario you either succeed with an exchange or get your money back. Atomex uses an on-chain implementation based on hashed timelock smart-contracts.<br><br><h2><b>How long does an atomic swap take?</b></h2><br>Depending on the chosen pair of cryptocurrency, the exchange may take from several minutes to an hour. The maximum time is 6 hours, after which the coins are returned to your crypto wallet.<br><br><h2><b>How are private keys stored?</b></h2><br>Your private keys are stored ONLY on your mobile wallet device, encrypted using AES-256. You have to unlock your crypto wallet with the encryption password on every start.<br><br><h2><b>Staking Tezos</b></h2><br>Stake Tezos (XTZ) from your own wallet with a delegation function. It brings passive income automatically. Delegation in Tezos is absolutely safe. Your coins are not locked or frozen and do not move anywhere. You can spend them at any time and without any delay from your Atomex wallet. Just keep in mind, you only delegate your rights, that‚Äôs it. Atomex wallet uses Tezos Baking Bad baker‚Äôs list.

I gave it 4 stars because it is not completely perfect to use and navigate, transaction history does not reflect all the transactions made by me whether it is sending or receiving coins and I wish the notifications of this app is working or is it just me because I am using an older version of android 8. I hope you can fix this and overall it is a good app not great.","This has got to be the worst crypto wallet I've ever used. Tons of bugs and glitches, complicated staking procedures, and the fees are very high. On top of that I lost coins due to a problem with the wallet and customer service is simply incapable of understanding my problem or helping. My advice would be to stay away from this app.","Works well for me and I do recommend. Sometimes it takes a little time for transactions to go through but this is true for most transactions of this type. One thing to makes sure is you keep enough etherum to pay for the transaction if that is what is used for the fees. So just don't zero it out is what I am saying.","Great app for a beginner, such as myself. More up and coming coins need to be added. The ability to sell and trade coins directly thru the wallet would make it the best on the market. And if you really want to solidify #1 spot, bring the community of AWC users together like they've done on my favorite trading platform.","Great app, easy to use. So many nice features. Could use some added features. It's hard to know what your total returns on investments is since it doesn't keep track of where you stared. Haven't had great success in identifying if I've made anything on my staking crypto either.

Grow your oak!","comments":["Overall app is fine and is good for savings. Really disappointed with Found Money. They say you earn money buying from partners, but the transactions never appear consistently. I have bought from a number of their partners, but never see the Found Money. And the process to get these transactions count is so cumbersome it's not even worth the effort. At this point I stay because my account is created and it's an easy way to save.","This app is great for saving and I appreciate having different ways to add to my savings (I use the round ups and weekly payments) the only issue that I've had with it is that if I select a weekly payment for a certain day, it doesn't actually take that money out of my checking account until half a week later, which defeats the purpose of setting a day altogether, but as for the actual saving, I really like having options that adjust risk/reward and the UI is very user friendly and easy to use.","I love the concept of investing spare change and watching it grow. I just wish we had a little more control over what and where the money was invested in. I would like possibly purchase precious metals, and commodities. I do like that you can cash out a little at a time if you need a few bucks. The found absolutely works perfect you can see who when and how much. I've made over 100 bucks in that alone","Good spending and saving experience. The inability to make mobile deposits after a YEAR of use (the app says 15 days, my wife can make mobile deposits after having her account for a month) keeps me from giving it 5 stars. I contacted customer service and was told that decision was made by a 3rd party and was out of customer service's hands. I had 1 problem where I couldn't use the account because thier system was being updated.","I love the app, and Acorns itself is pretty great. The invest and later accounts are my favorite. I like the spend because the card is really unique. Found money is a cool concept but I've used it and the ones that give it are pending for 120 days, and some just don't give it at all. Round ups are awesome as well. I opened early accounts for my children and those are slow to deposit funds, and I cannot access the early accounts from the app. All in all I love Acorns and highly recommend."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.acorns.android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.acorns.android&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Bitcoin Trading App - Bitcoin Flip","description":"Award Winning Bitcoin Trading Simulator for Beginners!\r\nüçæ  Risk free Trading = no real money involved  üçæ\r\n\r\nüì± Learn how to invest in TOP 18 digital currencies\r\nüí∏¬†Buy And Sell Free Bitcoin, Ether and other Altcoins\r\nü§© Feel the adrenaline of trading on rising Cryptocurrency market\r\n\r\n\r\nüè™ Trade Real Time -  Bitcoin BTC, Ethereum ETH, Litecoin LTC, Dashcoin DASH, Ripple XRP, Monero, Stellar, IOTA, Bitcoin Cash, Cardano, NEM, NEO, NANO, ZCASH, Tron, Vechain, STEEM & DodgeCoin.\r\n\r\nüèó Use Leverage to increase profits.\r\n\r\nüè´ Learn and develop best trading strategies before you take the plunge with real money.\r\n\r\nü§ù Have fun competing with other traders around the world.\r\nüèÜCompare and share your trading results with friends.\r\nüí∞ Start with $10,000 play money and see how much it grows.\r\n\r\nWhen you‚Äôve perfected your trading skills, choose from our carefully  hand selected Social trading brokers.\r\n\r\nMaster the market and flourish into the successful financial market trader you‚Äôve always wanted to be.\r\n\r\nGood Luck Flipping coins!\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------\r\nBitcoinFlip Game is made by Laura and Rolands\r\nTrading engine powered by financeillustrated.com","descriptionHTML":"<h1><b>Award Winning Bitcoin Trading Simulator for Beginners!</b></h1><br>üçæ <b> Risk free Trading = no real money involved</b>  üçæ<br><br><h2>üì± Learn how to <b>invest<b> in TOP 18 digital currencies</b></b></h2><br><h2>üí∏¬†Buy And Sell Free Bitcoin, Ether and other Altcoins</h2><br><h2>ü§© Feel the adrenaline of trading on rising Cryptocurrency market</h2><br><br><br>üè™ Trade Real Time -  <b>Bitcoin BTC, Ethereum ETH, Litecoin LTC, Dashcoin DASH, Ripple XRP, Monero, Stellar, IOTA, Bitcoin Cash, Cardano, NEM, NEO, NANO, ZCASH, Tron, Vechain, STEEM &amp;

Removing the ads is worth your two dollars. All in all, PERFECT! üëè","This is the best functionality of all the ones I've tried, however, it is a bit buggy. Sometimes the coins on the widget disappear and you have to hit refresh. Not a big deal but it does happen. Also, sometimes when I click on a coin in the widget and it opens in the app, it opens to the last thing I was looking at and not that coin. I'd be happy to work with support.","Everything is great, I also bought the ad free pro version. Just one BIG downside in widget, I'm not able to find any option for auto refresh (pro versions in few crypto apps do offer a feature where widget prices refresh automatically within the time interval you select). I know it can affect battery life, but i hope you can offer an upgrade with that feature with user having a choice to keep it off, or select auto refresh intervals like 2, 5, 10 mins, etc. Else it was 5 star for me","Ads are too frequent unless you pay. I had to edit as the developers think we are slow and don't understand the obvious.

The QR scanner helps a lot as well in order to transfer NFTS from one address to another in a fast way without writing down the whole address.

Thanks for working on it. Previous: Takes Deposits no problem. The moment you try to withdraw or exchange, endless problems. Part of this rating is their choice of Exchange. Changelly sucks huge.

Like others here have mentioned. I tried moving my dogecoin to another wallet and the transaction is stuck on pending.

I tried it at 2020 and it was all good at that time but now it is getting worse. They take 10 doge as a fee for transfer . Well as u can see 1 doge on other platforms. So as my experience this the worst app ever i have used . Its so worst that when i tried to transfer my dogecoin from cryptonator at the time when the fee was 1 doge it never happened. They failed my transfer every time and now they have just increase the doge fee.","Was working great at first but once dogecoin shot up it started having serious issues, it's been down for a month and tons of us are still waiting on a reply from you guys, your support isn't doing any supporting at all cause no one has gotten any answers, we're all left in the blind here, sooner or later you guys will have to answer for what you're doing.","Dogecoin went \"offline\" for two weeks, meaning you were unable to access your crypto, so no sending or trading. Completely ridiculous. 100% Scam Service. The value of the coin cut in half in that time. Cryptonator is NOT regulated and charges exorbitant fees. Use Binance or Coinbase instead.","I transferred my 23000 dogecoin in my another wallet in 19th May, but in my cryptonator transaction activity still showing my transaction in pending why? If system is pending from your side so please revert back my transaction. Last so many days I continues sent you reminder on your given mail id, but from your side no any response for me.

Had deposited INR but it hasn't reflected in my coindcx account yet. Raised request tickets, dropped mails, sent bank statements - no response. And I've been patient, this happened on the 29th of May. I'm not even sure what the situation is as there is no response. Ticket number: 499777 Issue still not resolved. It's been over a month.","Don't use this misleading app, Even after raising multiple tickets #529893, #527566, #541230 and #526988, I didn't recieve my money back they are misleading the customers and stealing money from them. The worst app ever, would give zero starts if there was an option. Edit-still didn't receive my money worst service ever.","In terms of interface the app is fantastic. This app can be a good starter for the beginners who are entering into the crypto market. Also, they are not charging any transaction fee as of now apart from mobiqwick. The major drawback that i faced is regarding the inr deposit. It took around 5 days to get reflected in my wallet. And right now they have removed the option as well. If the payment issue is resolved by providing instant option i personelly don't hesistate to give 5 stars.","There are alot of problems with this app: 1. Deposits are only possible with Mobiquick app and they usually charge 1.5% fee + 0.1% fee on every trade. 2. Deposits are not available or show some error 30% of the time and are not there when price of crypto drops 3. Support system is horrible and don't expect to get your problem fixed with a request. 4. Currencies like Dogecoin and Polkadot CANNOT be withdrawn and used so you don't even own some of the currencies.","The app has proven to be a failure when it comes to incorporating different payment methods.

Beware.","Simple, clean, and source available. Beware, though. They claim only the minimum blockchain fees are assessed but the build distributed here charges multiple doge, sometimes tens or even hundreds, when Dogecoin famously only requires 1 doge for even large transactions. Where are these extra doge going? Are they going somewhere or are users simply forced to overpay? No option to edit fee. Strangely, it seems honest and correct for other coins. I use the langerhans wallet for Dogecoin anyway but it's frustrating because I'd like to recommend this one for general multi-coin use.","Says it converts DOGE, then doesn't let you. Transferred crypto over to it and now wasted a fee to do that and going to get charged for going somewhere else. This is a waste of your time, find another app, another site, anywhere that you can that will let you convert what you want to. Seems pretty dodgy to advertise something and then not do anything that you've said. The app is easy enough to use, and that's the only reason for not giving a 1, simple and basic, nothing to say there, but definitely not worth your time for trading.","Great app just having trouble getting a old account back as I don't know of the log in","Charged me a $10 fee for buying $30 of Bitcoin, then only alaws me to send half of what I put in.

I have had payments pending for what seems like an age and yet I am told by support to wait 15 days!, everytime I enquire?? We are dealing with DIGITAL here! All of this is hypersonic transactions so no excuse for slowing payment in my opinion. I paid for next level above free hoping it would make it more reliable, I was wrong.","Well to be honest, I don't want to rate this app just one star but because I have problems with my three requests and I emailed them to help but all they do is just tell me to wait for 15 days and I waited it for a couple months but nothing happened. Well don't download it you aren't can I get anything from them. I would come back to rate this app better if they can help but I guess not I've been with it for too long.","Whole thing is a fraud. Count resets, they don't pay. I've got 3 payments pending going on 3 weeks. Nothing but Hasbin crooked so called development team, couldn't get anything right! A certain quantum program coming will set things straight. They even try to put the old review on, the laughter will come as the encryption is torn apart. Or you're busted by cyber feds, either way.","Scam!!!! This app is not something you should use. I spent over 100 on app and I new something went wrong when the app stop working on me. I logged out and I try to talk to \"customer service\" and it they claimed to fix it. Go on their website and reverse search the photos of the founders of the app. Those images are used on other websites as well.","Started out good and reasonably easy to use. Had some Sat disappear assuming because I \"hadn't banked\". I put a withdrawal request in on the 19/06/21 which is still sitting as Pending, contacted customer service about a week later and have been waiting for a response since.

I know the more contact you have with more iot devices and such allows for more rewards but I teach in a classroom and of course a school with 200+ students and I have accumulated 1/10th of a nodle cash token in 2.5 months. It's fairly measley in my opinion. Love the concept though!!","I earned a bunch of nodle cash and it stopped accruing one day. After a few days I figured out this was happening to others and it needed updated. I updated and it took everything. This would not happen on a legitimate project, how many others did this happen to that didn't leave a review. I was pretty happy with what I was earning, really liked the concept of this and looked into it extensively. I was really excited to see where this project would go. Then an update took everything.","Super neat little app. Doesn't slow my phone or drain the battery very much at all. I'd recommend managing your expectations. You're not gonna make a boat load of money off your phone being a node but as a crypto hobbyist, this app hits a really great sweet spot.","I've transferred over 60,000 packets in ludicrous mode. Rewards still say 0.0 earned. I've turned battery optimization off and have the app allowed to run in background, but it never works in the background. If you leave the app open, it works for a few minutes, then you need to close and reopen to get it going again. Not sure what the problem is, but looks like I'm not the only one.","I know this is just your copy & paste response but the app already has permission to run in the background while using mobile data, what other reason do you have for this ridiculously low earning rate? Don't waste your time. I've had it on ludicrous mode since I've downloaded the app, have over 325,000 packets and have made just over 2 tenths of one coin, which is insane considering it has absolutely no value"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"io.nodle.cash","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.nodle.cash&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Nominex: Cryptocurrency trading without commission","description":"Welcome to Nominex cryptocurrency exchange, the best exchange to start cryptocurrency trading, trusted by thousands of professional traders and newbies around the world.\r\n\r\nNominex provides the opportunity to trade Bitcoin, Ethereum, NMX, Link, Tezos, Cardano, BNB and many other cryptocurrencies WITHOUT any fees - thanks to the internal utility DeFi-token NMX, which will be issuing to the market for 72 years using the mechanics of DeFi Yield Farming.\r\n\r\nNominex is working on integrating the Binance brokerage program and very soon users will have the opportunity to trade cryptocurrencies in fact on the Binance exchange, but through the Nominex website on more favorable terms, namely, trade WITHOUT commission - thanks to the unique utilitarian farming mechanism of DeFi NMX token!\r\n\r\nWhat is utilitarian farming?\r\nThe more you put funds in the liquidity pool, the higher level you get on the Nominex exchange itself - so when you send 10,000 USDT to the liquidity pool, you get the maximum level, and you will be able to trade with zero commissions or trading fees on the Nominex cryptocurrency exchange.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRADING WITHOUT KYC\r\n\r\nNominex allows you to withdraw and deposit cryptocurrency equivalent to 3 BTC per day without KYC checks.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPPORT VISA and MASTERCARD\r\n\r\nDeposit and withdraw funds in a convenient way.\r\n\r\n\r\nCRYPTO TRADING\r\n\r\nNominex has implemented advanced order types and APIs for easily trading:\r\n\r\nStop Order:\r\nUsed to trigger a trade when the market falls or rises to the set stop price.\r\n\r\nStop Limit Order:\r\nConsists of two prices: stop price and limit price.

Unfortunately it did not work at all. Of course, the internet of the mobile was also good and there was no excuse The application did not ask me for any information. Just wanted the pool name, which was \"supportxmr\". And then transferred to the ID creation section. After introducing the username and email and giving the password twice, the system thought a little and then gave the above message.","It was working great but since subscribing I now cannot get whatomine to work at all and some of the pools are very difficult to set up as there are no instructions and some have no API key available.

The exchange and withdrawal fees are outrageous. You will get better returns on your PC if you invest same amount.","Wasted my money on this one, when you take into consideration the electrical fee, and the withdraw fee, it would take over 100 days of mining to withdraw 0 dollars, and without the withdraw fee, it already takes over a year to recoup the money it takes to get the rate. Basically, it will take you maybe 2 years, to break even in your dollar value assume coin price stays the same. Just buy coin or get your own miner.","I've been with hashiny for a little over 2 years and have stuck it out. The electricity fees are high but support is quick to respond and assured that it will change for the better. That's the only issue I've had so hopefully it will. Then I'll give 5 stars!","Been mining with them for about 6 months now. Electric fees are to high and withdrawal fees are even higher. When you are able to withdraw at .1 you are able to withdraw 0.0000 token...wish I would have used a different app but for now im stuck for 2 years probably more to profit...lower fees and lower electricity fee and I will definitely give 5+ stars because the app itself is well organized and easy to use and navigate.

Comparing to it's competitor Bin**ce, it lacks certain features and some of it I would regard it as essential. 1. Notifications - No notification when your orders are filled. 2.

I downloaded it in hopes that I could invest into the lesser-known and smaller Cryptos outside Coinbase, but now I'm believing it to be impossible. For one thing, there's no option at all to validate your account if you're a US citizen; I'm listed under China, no USA option. I can still deposit, buy coins and purchase KYC... but let's be honest - Who wants to fund an unverified, unsecured account? Not me.","Customer service is terrible! The app had a bug where it withdrew tokens on the wrong chain. I selected ERC, and it withdrew on BSC. They confirmed this was an issue, and to contact the other exchange to get my tokens back. I did that and was charged fee by the other exchange. Kucoin said they would reimburse the fee after the coins were returned.Kucoin now refuse responsibility, and are trying to blame me for selecting the wrong chain - I did not.

So why 3stars? Because out of a list of 20-30coins you only receive about 5. At least update the list lads erase them from the game if we can't win them. And to end this pht is dropping with entire market. Kinda sad by the time you manage to get the minimum to withdraw it still worths pretty much nothing. Other apps pay satoshi. Why not here? Why such high limit to withdraw :/?","For now I'm giving it 5 Stars. It's slow going earning crypto but I'm earning. I noticed when I go into the wallet that there are cryptos being discontinued by the game. It takes a large amount before u can even think to withdraw. Now I have to wait and see if I lose any crypto collected when something I have is discontinued and I'm not at the minimum withdrawal. That will change the game to 0 Stars.

I have only accrued about 5$ thru the entire coin base they offer.. One more thing. You cannot collect jems which are needed to redeem collections.

I like that I can pass the time and generate passive income. I haven't tried to withdraw yet, but only because it says you can earn 5% if you have over 35k in coin. Sounds good to me. I will only change this rating if it for some reason doesn't allow me to withdraw my earned btc. Anyway, enjoying the app and happy to make some dough. Thanks Cointiply!","At first it was very good. Playtime was brilliant. I hardly change the device because the other one had a problem. This was said on both devices at once: this is not compatible with my device. 5 minutes before there were no problems. Even after I reset the cache and the GAID, it is not possible the support just says that my phone is not compatible. 5 minutes before everything works, you are simply fobbed off, and that after 4-5 days until you get an answer in support gets a shame. And i see it coming an standard answer here who says plz reset the GAID and Cache -.- or plz contact our support (that what i have done before i make the review.","This is one of the better sites to make a few dollars. They pay very well (relatively) to play their app games. I admit the games are just boring luck based ones, but still, they pay pretty well. The hourly roll for free coin is more data intensive than other apps and the capcha is a bit of a pain, but it's free. I also like the idea that they pay interest if you have 35k coin balance. I've made about $10 in coin in two weeks.","Great site, I just wish the surveys were more available to get. *edit: Thanks for the response :D another great reason to like this site!. I was just getting a lot of sad face emojis & \"this survey isn't for you\" Everything else seems so well balanced and even entertaining, keep up the great work!","This WAS a great app until the survey issues (see previous review) but hey, the games were working great until about 10 minutes ago when I took a break and now can't play them anymore due to \"device not supported\".

Stuck with BTC, ETH, and other \"good\" crypto because they no longer pay those out, and the withdraw amount is much too high. They keep changing their alt coins so you'll never safe up enough to withdraw, then keep increasing withdraw limits. If you ever meet the minimum it does pay, but the time/effort is nowhere near worth it.","Well for me 1) The game kinda gets boring for me after the quests you know, maybe you guys could add some new game features & maybe like somethings we can be upgrading to earn more Phoneum or Diamonds & XP. 2) It's hard to earn at least $5 with six months of gameplay like seriously guys. Why don't you guys reduce the number of crypto or you could just make it tailored to something you can afford in plenty. Although great game, working smoothly on my phone; try it out and see if it's your taste.","The worst game of all of the pht farming games, simply due to the 'catch you out' layout of the block chain chest. I don't want to purchase this chest but if I try to close a game too vigorously it will often close and purchase the chest chest as it lies directly underneath the close button. This is the third time it's stolen my PHT for Tron Weekly Journal and other alternative coins I don't want. Reverse this unwanted transaction and adjust the layout. Until then this review will stay.","Decent amount of crypto rewarded if you put time/money into each game. Watch adds to earn PHT coin then exchange for blockchain chests there you'll find the best rewards. Not much depth so no need to think hard for lack of better word, sit back watch some TV or what ever and have it playing in back ground while making crypto","To be honest im probably not going to be able to withdraw cryptos in my life time and im 42 years old. I think you should lower your withdraw minimum. The games are simple but pretty boring. Im not sure its worth the effort. Other games are better and earn pht alot faster.

Merging the digital world with the physical world makes this an app that is both profitable and fun! I highly recommend grabbing the Sentinel Card since it's free for now (except shipping). If you're frequently on the road this could be a serious side hustle! If you're not, it's still fun, lucrative, and free!","Since the last update my coin map is stock on loading, this update is bad. New update: I later figure out that my location was turn off and the app fail to inform me, secondly getting a decent amount without upgrading is impossible, sadly the upgrade is expensive especially for people who aren't daily drivers. It is pretty much waste of time if you aren't a premium member and a driver.","Fun. Free basic plan is slow but it's worth it for the premium plans as you do usually make more than the subscription cost if you remember to use it everytime you're out and about ( gets easy ). Sentinel is on its way and may help with that, will update once I know. Update ~ sentinel helps alot! Recommend 100%. High paying surveys are broken! Please fix. Surveys are 90% broken now. Review is reflecting the problems.","I like the ability to mine coin, but I'm not liking the SentinelX card. It won't let my other apps operate when it's being detected. Won't let reward videos play.. Causes my phone to lose GPS location while using Google maps. Also, for 35 dollars for the card and a pro membership, I'm still getting the same coin rewards from mining that I was with just a pro account. Also, why can I link my coinbase wallet, but can't buy xyo coin on coinbase?","Great fun! Likes newer phones 7 series or newer. Just noticed my review from almost two years ago. Wow have we come along way!! If I'm moving, I'm mining. Mine them coins and convert them to tokens. Never thought this would pay off the way it has. We are still climbing and and I'm excited for the future. Play and learn. Get yourself a crypto wallet and redeem every chance you get. It may not seem like much when you do, but a pair of Diamond hands will make it grow. Good luck fellow miners."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"network.xyo.coin","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=network.xyo.coin&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Unfinance - Finance & Business News in 60 words","description":"Join India's fastest growing community of 200,000+ intelligent investors. \r\n\r\nUnfinance is empowering Indians to invest in share market and manage their finances in an intelligent manner. \r\n\r\nDisclaimer: We are promoting financial literacy in India.

The only suggestion I might make is to improve contrast on detail text, for those of us with older eyes. Great job!!?","maybe improve the UI and appearance; everything is so plain & rectangular. Add haptic feedback too when buttons are pressed. .... In the digit input screen, pull or bring down the keypad a bit ‚Äî there's a large unused space at the bottom. EDIT: 5 stars to 3 stars. why? (1.) when you set the list of currencies to show in alphabetical order in the homepage, it resets to random order if the app is closed. (2.) The exchange rate for Naira is FALSE/WRONG. It reports double.","Love the app and simplicity however I wish I could paste my values in the calculator. I have to manually type in the value and keep having to switch back and forth between apps to get the exact number. Copy and paste would make this app 5*s.","Almost perfect, it has most coins, if not all coins I have ever needed to check the price for. I hated having to browse for exchanges to check the prices and only to find that I couldn't get the values for very small amounts.

Very timely for the most part, and when seemingly backlogged they are very patient with understandibly nervous customers, and work hard to get things right. Have been very pleased even though my first transaction error i experienced made me very sceptical, they proved that wrong. A joy to interface with compared to some banks. the app is simple and elegant, is very intuitive to use.","Works pretty well and the new update has improved syncing. One improvement I suggest is to improve the user experience with syncing, since it takes a long time. If you could show progress more closely instead of updating only every few hundred blocks that would be good. Or adding an estimated time until completion might also be good.","Used to work fine on my Android phone. But XMR won't sync anymore or connect to any nodes, all show red. Tried wifi 2.4 and 5ghz, mobile data, mobile hotspot, even used a LAN line with a USBC connection. Works fine on my ipad 7 tho. Only thing I can think of is I now have dual Sims on phone.","Lost 400$ when I went to exchange, Went to a completely unknown btc address. Been a week and still no answer or idea.

Edit: I know that it's secure - too secure! My office got broken into and all my paperwork destroyed. Making excuses oppose to listening to those who use your app is just poor customer service and am now reducing my rating to 1 because of that.","My experience has been so good, i felt i needed to write a review for others who need a good wallet and cant decide based on others feedback. The app is so user friendly. Is very easy on the eyes. Is super quick. Ive downloaded close to 15 other wallet apps and with BRD i transferred in some BCH (bitcoin cash) the transfers were lightening speed. Literally in split seconds. And network fees $0.00. Wallet fees? $0.00. Yes it cost me absolutely nothing to send BCH in split seconds. I love it 5/5.","I tested this app when it first came out some years ago. Back then it was by far one of the best wallets available and it still is! Security is strong and it has a host of useful features such as the ability to import encrypted private keys from paper wallets you may have cold storage. It also allows you to sweep both BTC and bitcoin cash from wallets created pra to any forks. Don't be put off by some of the negative reviews, if you read them you will find most of them are unreasonable.","Pretty good app for the most part but sometimes you will get an error message when trying to trade between cryptos and it only give a error code and does not tell you what went wrong. Most of the ti.e it is because the app doesn't want you to transfer all of your coin to another coin. For ie. If I have $500 in BTC and want to put that all into ETH I will get an error code. Now if I leave $20 in my BTC and transfer the rest it works pretty good. Buy BRD coin you will save money in trading coin.","Horrible app for your crypto wallet. As soon as my last few transactions clear I am uninstalling. I have been using this app for over a year now and it has literally got worse over time. Transactions take forever for no reason. Overcharge for everything. Trust me...find another wallet.

I was told third party handles deposits and it would be a few hours that was 6 hrs ago shamefull amount of time for crypto to be transfered. Idk happens every deposit no smooth deposits.","Support is terrible, over a week and still no reply. Cold wallet staking provide full reward, through mycointainer you get reduced reward and on top of that you get hit with a reward fees. Eg. Cosmos self staking you get 9-10%, mycointainer 8.1% minus 0.41% reward fees. Even though provide easy staking services but dig deep into your rewards.","I started using My Container in June 2020 and I have deposited a bunch of coins on there, also subscribed to the POWER subscription. At first it did run smooth but now I do not get coins every month for the extra subscription. There are some things that I do not agree with, one is that the POWER subscription just got raised without any notice, the second one is that there is a minimum withdrawal for coins and the third is that one does not get rewards for the coins he gets on the subscription. The phone app is a bit shady and has some glitches once in a while like not showing exact amounts, or mistaking the amounts received with euro currency. My humble opinion is that it is a service that can be improved. I would like to see more details on the coins and earnings, 8 decimals as they should be. I would like to not have a minimum withdrawal and maybe get rewards for the rewarded coins one gets. Besides these things that some wouldn't consider minor, the service is a decent staking and masternode service. I do enjoy the giveaways that they have once in a while. Thank you","The app isn't too bad. It lacks all the features you'll find on the website, but it keeps up. This app is pretty much unlike most others in terms of crypto currencies. They offer you airdrops left and right and all sorts of ways to earn. There are some downsides. My KYC verification took about 20 tries. I'm not sure why, but it did eventually go through. If you are looking for an app that will reward you for staking crypto this one will do it. Just be alert that you'll need to stake ~$100 worth of whatever it is you are staking, or you won't be able to withdraw it until it hits that level. The APR earnings are just ridiculously high so it's definitely worth investing some time and effort into. I'll be using them for a a while.","Unexpectedly robust app! Walked through the app for to login and check the mobile UI. Perfect and Very tidy! But it would be more entertaining and not boring if you guys add some twist on it, some rewarding game/s, maybe spin the wheel, some scratching games, or coin prediction. As a user and money making online hunter, that is a ++ bonus. Or daily check in that rewards that makes us go check the app daily. :)"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.mycontainer","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mycontainer&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"ProfitTrading For Binance - Trade much faster","description":"** New feature!

Also prices (rates) take some time to update. I usually use the synch holdings feature and everything gets updated eventually. My connection seems  fine and other apps work faster but yours is very good, thanks","Has everything I need, but the GUI needs some tweaking. Some settings are hard to find. Takes a while to learn how to use it properly. I like that I can define the amount of money I have invested and it compares the worth of the portfolio to that value.","love it, It does the job of three of my old apps, so I was able to free up more space on my phone and now I dont have to bounce between apps to see my portfolio, check prices on altcoins, read current news, I just wish we could get an exchange and everything this app has all in one, now that would be a good setup.","The best portfolio app I've come across. Other apps are super flowery and pretty and take forever to load up and do anything on my phone. The person who made this understands that it's more important that the app be useful than keep up with the latest greatest and prettiest design trends that buckle any non-like 8 core beast machine smartphone. I would give it 5 stars if the address tracking let you enter addresses via QR codes. If you have a lot of accounts, it can take forever to copy the addresses by cut and paste. Especially on wallet apps that make you enter a code or do 2FA every time you switch away from them. If I could just pull up my accounts on wallet's web interface and just scan qr codes in seconds, that'd be a lot easier. Other apps let you do this, but their list of accepted tokens is a total and complete joke compared to this one. Like literally some except 8 tokens and not even like the top 8 by market cap. Just a joke. If this takes QR codes, it's killing every other

But there is big issue in the order process. The buying limit is always processed after setting the buying amount/price. So if you have not enough cash you cant buy with a lower buy limit. The cash check should be applied after setting the limit, not before. The other things are not that crucial, but would make it nicer: More watch lists, procentual changes in the portfolio list, more informations about the ETFs in the app.","Update: Finally worked after the 3rd try. You really need a better identity provider than PostIdent. Previous Review: Useless so far. Onboarding process doesn't complete, even though the PostIdent process is successfully completed. After contacting customer support (after waiting 3 days) they say my identification is rejected and I have to goto post office again (even though PostIdent website says it's successful). But the app doesn't say it's rejected, only that I have still do the identification. After doing PostIdent for a second time, app still shows I have to do the PostIdent. Cannot reach customer support.","Verification process is a joke. I did my first postident in Jan, nothing happened. I received response on the ticket 4 months later to try with new code. I tried again. When asked for the status, I was informed the verification failed by Deutsche post (I have done the process few times before for different purposes). When I asked for more details I received reaponse the verification was successful and need my city registration. Now, i received feedback postident verification was unsuccessful","Update: I contacted support again a month ago. They just don't reply, ever. Update: It's now been a month and a half and support still haven't replied. Original review: I still can't use the app. Very slow identity check. I performed the postId over a month ago. Submitted proof of my German address weeks ago. Contacted support for an update over a week ago. No answer from support and I still can't use the app.","Registration process was very smooth and fast. Overall the UI looks cool but don't expect to get any more information than the price chart and the name of the stock/ETF etc..

I created an account went through the tutorial and it gave 2000 acf pts. Gave me a button to click on it Said \"Register now.\" Big bright yellow box. The button said to \"COMPLETE\" my registration in order to save my progress. I clicked it and it sent me through the tutorial again. Once completed it said it was deducting my acf points for detecting fraud from opening more than 1 account and then stripped me of all the coins. Now the only way I can get more than is real $$$..What a JOK","Cool concept but poor execution. I am a crypto fan boy and I really wanna like this game but it can't keep my attention as it doesn't seem to have a flow to the game. Even with the tutorial and an understanding of crypto exchange interfaces I cannot seem to find meaningful things to do.","Updating my review. Thanks to Tom for reinstating my account. Now that I'm actually able to play, i can say this app is fun and informative. The contests are good and some are categorized and only allow those cryptos (in order for you to learn what each crypto is used for ie. Privacy coins, currency coins). For the simulation part, it is great. It has basically all the features and options a real exchange would have. The price changes are delayed though. I enjoyed the margin trading too","I've been using this app for over a year. It's good practice, it's fun and if you place well enough in the contests they ACTUALLY pay you. Also, the support team answers and solves issues you might have in a timely fashion. If I had the money I would totally pay to be a gold member, although, I feel like I should be grand-fathered in just because I've been a loyal patron for so long. Maybe they will consider???","The app is a great way to still participate on the go. One thing to improve: the buy/sell pages - it is hard to slide the amount to buy or sell when you can switch tabs by swiping. Using a slider on a swipeable tab is not easy to use if you want to for example sell all your current coins. I suggest using the same methodology of the website by adding the 25, 50, 75, 100 percentages to choose. Apart from this, app is fast and never has given me any problems."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.altcoinfantasy.altcoinfantasy","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.altcoinfantasy.altcoinfantasy&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Coinigy","description":"Coinigy is the most comprehensive bitcoin and cryptocurrency trading and portfolio management tool available.

The app is atrocious for shopping/browsing stores through the app. Can't get logged into some stores, can't navigate on others. Back button will have you starting over, etc.","It's a good concept, but the past few times I've played games to get rewards, the reward disappears before I'm able to complete it. It'll say in the rules \"within 20 days of installing\" and I'll go check on the status within 7, and the reward info isn't even available. This has happened to me twice. It doesn't even store it in my history. I'm frustrated.","Ordered some things on Aliexpress. At first, I thought it didn't work, but in a week or so the points showed up for my purchases. Good app, good concept. Can be improved, of course but going in the right direction.","Pretty cool to earn crypto rewards for shopping and playing games on ur phone!

I would appreciate it if there was an edit button when uploading the documents this is because the absence of it causes a delay in rectifying a mistake when one uploads the wrong document. Also deposits still don't reflect in 24hours even if they're the same bank, please address that.","Currently it takes 24hrs for a deposit to reflect on the app even if made from the same bank. Overall app interface is too limited and needs to be more intuitive with more functions and features. Great examples are Plus500 and Binance apps. Thanks for taking the time to read this and hopefully you'll be able to implement some more features on your app.","I am honestly fed up, I have been using altcointrader for over a year now, Have u guys ever thought of having a live chat facility???

Will update if fixed. Email many times, messaged from the dashboard on website and put in multiple requests for missing Satoshi and not fixed. They keep taking the Satoshi that their customers accumulate on their app. You build up 10,000 plus sat on any or multiple tabs on the app one day it's gone.

Even when you manually force update a coin price, you would see the gain/loss percent change but not the actual price. Kinda defeats the entire purpose unless you just wanted a general idea of how the currency is doing. 2) I couldn't figure out how to add more than one coin tracker. Looks like you should be able to, yet there was no \"add\" button. I decided to go with another app.","This app is great, I own a bunch of different crypto coins from several apps this gives me customizable widgets that let me track the value of my coins without having to open each exchange. My only issue with it is sometimes the connection fails and I'm not able to track for a bit. It does lag behind a bit, but as I'm not day trading this isn't a problem for me.","Exactly the widget I wanted, but I'd like to see some updates. It would be nice if I could add a label to each coin. I hold crypto for various family members and would like to label each widget with their names. Also it would be nice to see the actual price of the coin rather than the cash value of my coins.","Very nice. The refresh isn't working. I had a little crashing problem when I lost internet. Next to that, it's a very cool widget option.","Would be a 5 star if I could add more than a billion coins. I can't add my billions to this widget, cool layout though and idea.

Major problem is the lag which often ends in crashes. Everytime it does that, all the scores and GWEI went with it, leaving you back on level 1. Crashes are very common when you're doing great with your game. It's like it does not favor that you win and make great points. As to the ETH you can earn, it's too minute and almost neglible to even think playing this game for years can change your life in the long run.","Amazing game ! I find myself sitting down for a quick 5-10 game and an hour later I'm still playing. It really does pay out, instantly ! EDIT : 07-25-21 The game used to be 5 stars, now it's a weak 3 star game. Adds have increased 100%. I just scored 32000+ and for that effort, I was given 675 gwei ?!! A score like that should have paid out 4x that amount. Come on team, don't get cheap on us, the price of Ethereum is down. The payout SHOULD GO UP !!!!!!","Does what it says it does. Great mindless game for meetings or when watching TV. If you're going to mess around on Candy Crush, why not get paid for it? I've made some decent cash off of this and it's funding my smaller crypto investments. Yeah, there's ads. You get used to them, especially once you know how long they last. Just put the tv on and look up when an ad comes on. Great app, wish there were more like it.","Pays out easily and quickly with coinbase. 5 stars. The game is fun. BUT!!! constantly glitches and you have to start over. I was just on a roll, my best game. Start of level 6, a flash, and im back at level 1, and my coins are gone! You still get credit for ETH. But its totally deflating, and makes people stop playing. IF THE GAME STOPPED CRASHING ID GIVE 5 STARS AND PLAY MORE. VERY DISAPPOINTED","Sure enough, it pays out Ethereum almost instantly. It's kind of hard to get figured out, though. You need to go into where it says redeem in order to get it sent to your wallet. Doesn't add up fast at all, but it's an all right time waster. And tons of ads, but that should be a given for anyone looking at this kind of thing. I'd love to see a cleaner interface and more information about how much is paid out per point, but that's easy enough to figure out."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.mansoon.cryptopop","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mansoon.cryptopop&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Airdrops - Crypto Tokens","description":"Ever heard of airdrops?
