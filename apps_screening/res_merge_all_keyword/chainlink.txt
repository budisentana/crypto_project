Now for the cons of this app. The app does run slow and act up sometimes. Also the huge fees the force on you everything you make any transaction between both sell and buying.

I think they need to make it more clear that those arrows on the side are the send and receive buttons. I think they should also display your balance first before they show the price of the cryptocurrency. What I mean is that instead of having to switch to see your balance I think you should have to switch to see the price of what ever cryptocurrency you are on. Other than those two things the app is amazing! 😄👏🏼","This wallet is all we need. More and more coins are added and the best part is that this wallet is user friendly. I highly suggest to use their desktop wallet for best experience. Their support is also superb. I can still remember when I had some issues with my deposits way back in 2017, they were helpful and very professional. Keep it up exodus, cheers!","Slider shows wrong value when you are at 6 months scope - how can be peak of a price graph be 30 while the dip is 50? I do remember when I bought but it is about money it really shouldn't show wrong values. Nice design. I would like to see auto note about price when I did recive or send. And my average - just a lil bit of analytics. ( any price graph has this bug - it is more apparent with scope 1+ month)","The app is indeed very convenient; its design is well suited for everyday crypto needs, however the problem on my phone (which is running Android 8.1) is that the app requires more CPU and RAM resources than the phone is okay dealing with, which results in a significant delay when loading the UI screen for each requested functionality; in short - it's slow. Other than that it's a great tool to have. For legit advice on acquiring Bitcoin with zero investment see cb.run/earn-bitcoin-free","Exodus is by far the best wallet when it comes to UI/UX.

Some coins do work, like Bitcoin, but BCH was transferred to this wallet and even after checking the block explorer and seeing that there were 50 confirmations, still no log of the transfer even after 7 hours. People in the U.S. need to keep track of this for tax purposes but it's not too reliable. I'm not sure about all of the coins but LTC is another one that should be examined. Thanks.","Works well keeping in mind its Binance on the Binance blockchains. It does Ethereum Mainnet as well, but will not allow DEX between blockchains. Also will not allow swap between blockchains. So if you have ETH or USDT and want BTC (or visa versa) this will not work for you. Otherwise it is a nice wallet that pays interest on a few held assets (mostly BNB).","It would be the perfect wallet if it had more Binance Smart Chain coin swap options. Dapp browser conflicts with Android Web View sometimes causing loading of exchanges to slow down immensely. Support for ease of access to exchanges is incredible and top quality. In App Price chart is slow to reflect real-time value and tends to lag behind the real time value of coins 9/10 times. In App buy minimum to fund the wallet is painfully high most times. Suggest sending funds to wallet from elsewhere","So far My experience using the trust wallet app has been very good I must admit.... BUT, BUT, BUT your continuous habit of deleting users transaction history/ID everytime the app is updated is a big FAILURE , y'all really need to find a solution to this issue... There isn't any backup feature which allows TX history/ID to be saved & this can be a big issue for many users from different parts of the globe.... As a early user of TW having access to my TX history/ID is very important .... Pls Fix","I was initially a little upset with Trust Wallet because of some issues I was having, but they have great customer service! Now that I know how to fully use the app, it is very easy and I like it. Edit: I lowered my review to 3 stars. I have used a lot of crypto apps and this is definitely the most difficult one to use.

I know the more contact you have with more iot devices and such allows for more rewards but I teach in a classroom and of course a school with 200+ students and I have accumulated 1/10th of a nodle cash token in 2.5 months. It's fairly measley in my opinion. Love the concept though!!","I earned a bunch of nodle cash and it stopped accruing one day. After a few days I figured out this was happening to others and it needed updated. I updated and it took everything. This would not happen on a legitimate project, how many others did this happen to that didn't leave a review. I was pretty happy with what I was earning, really liked the concept of this and looked into it extensively. I was really excited to see where this project would go. Then an update took everything.","Super neat little app. Doesn't slow my phone or drain the battery very much at all. I'd recommend managing your expectations. You're not gonna make a boat load of money off your phone being a node but as a crypto hobbyist, this app hits a really great sweet spot.","I've transferred over 60,000 packets in ludicrous mode. Rewards still say 0.0 earned. I've turned battery optimization off and have the app allowed to run in background, but it never works in the background. If you leave the app open, it works for a few minutes, then you need to close and reopen to get it going again. Not sure what the problem is, but looks like I'm not the only one.","I know this is just your copy & paste response but the app already has permission to run in the background while using mobile data, what other reason do you have for this ridiculously low earning rate? Don't waste your time. I've had it on ludicrous mode since I've downloaded the app, have over 325,000 packets and have made just over 2 tenths of one coin, which is insane considering it has absolutely no value"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"io.nodle.cash","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.nodle.cash&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Free Dogecoin","description":"With this app you can claim Dogecoin for free every hour.

Email reset won't send. App is up to date. No response other than an automated email saying there was a problem and to update. Concerned my account was compromised and whomever is having all the time in the world to steal my money and identity. AT BEST Voyager has stolen $100 plus dollars from me. DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE Once again I have to file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau.","Super easy to use. Nice to be able to fund asap unlike a lot of other exchanges or custodians. Entry to the crypto space is great. Following areas of improvement: the \"Slide/Swipe\" to buy is a bit weird as I'd prefer something like a button with less motion. The app could be made more snappier. Scrolling left/right to holdings performance is a bit weird. But aside from all that, I'm a fan of the product and business model. THE INTEREST IS JUST AWESOME 😎.","Be ready to pay a premium. You will always buy at the ask price and sell at the bid price. The difference on the app is 2-5%. So potentially u will lose 5% when you buy and when you sell. Most good exchanges the difference is way less than .05%... Here you are in the hole 10% by the time you cash out. Crypto withdrawal fees are highest in business as well.. over $40 for some tokens, compared to $2-4 for others. That said the app is very easy to use and UI is great. Worth it?- you decide","#SHIBARMY ALL THE WAY! Thanks for listing! Update: After posting my review I read others and I am confused with the latest comments. I've used Voyager for about a month and a half and it has been nothing but a great app. I have never experienced any lag on transferring fiat to and from the app. Never any issues with buying or converting crypto; no issues what so ever. Don't know what they mean, Voyager is one of the easiest apps to invest in crypto.","Started off okay. Not sure about the fees but my issue is that I can't log in or change my password due to \"internal server issues\". This has been going on for weeks now. Absolutely no access to my account and crypto.

In this update:<br>- Bug fixes &amp; improvements","comments":["I really enjoy the app! I use the card for purchases I would make like gas and snack food because you get a little CRO back so I thought why not. Buying coins is easy as well. The only part I don't really understand is the card tiers say you need a minimum staked in dollars to go up a tier, but then when I go to stake there is a minimum written in CRO or whatever other coin I've tried staking. Other than that I really enjoy the app and if you're wanting a debit card for crypto, this one works!","App is not incredibly intuitive, but it's still pretty solid. Only 3 stars because app doesn't work at all in newest version of Android beta, which is currently preventing me from accessing my investments. Reduced another star (now 2) as it's not been a month since the Android 12 beta went public and has even had an update, but this app has still not been fixed. It's the only app that I've encountered that does not work in the beta.","This is the most complicated app I've ever dealt with for crypto buying selling and tracking. It's takes forever, selling and trading is extremely confusing. Only reason I am using it is ability to buy diverse coins. 1 star is very harsh, but its obvious this app is designed for the educated when it comes to crypto, people new to crypto currency would be better served going somewhere else. Trading, buying, or transferring needs to be made more simple .","I purchased crypto worth $3,520. I was showing this amount but when the transaction complete I was charged a fee even though it did not show the box where I have to check it and agree to the fee. I contact customer service many times but no luck I told them it was a glitch on their end but the customer service is like a robot.. they just copy and paste.. total scam I do not recommend it. I am in a process to cancel my account.","Overall the app is nice, that is if you get to open it! I've been using it for 6m now and would like to see faster replies from the customer service agents and limit orders when buying coins. Ah, I didn't get my referral credit too. A bit more generous rewards for staking would be appreciated too. Other than that, it has a nice selection of coins and it's quite easy to use."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"co.mona.android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.mona.android&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"ViaWallet - Multi chain Wallet","description":"ViaWallet is a multi-chain and multi-cryptocurrency decentralized wallet issued by ViaBTC.

But have to give em 1 star btc deposit is curently at 11 hrs and counting since being fully confirmed on the blockchain but not reflected in account. I was told third party handles deposits and it would be a few hours that was 6 hrs ago shamefull amount of time for crypto to be transfered. Idk happens every deposit no smooth deposits.","Support is terrible, over a week and still no reply. Cold wallet staking provide full reward, through mycointainer you get reduced reward and on top of that you get hit with a reward fees. Eg. Cosmos self staking you get 9-10%, mycointainer 8.1% minus 0.41% reward fees. Even though provide easy staking services but dig deep into your rewards.","I started using My Container in June 2020 and I have deposited a bunch of coins on there, also subscribed to the POWER subscription. At first it did run smooth but now I do not get coins every month for the extra subscription. There are some things that I do not agree with, one is that the POWER subscription just got raised without any notice, the second one is that there is a minimum withdrawal for coins and the third is that one does not get rewards for the coins he gets on the subscription. The phone app is a bit shady and has some glitches once in a while like not showing exact amounts, or mistaking the amounts received with euro currency. My humble opinion is that it is a service that can be improved. I would like to see more details on the coins and earnings, 8 decimals as they should be. I would like to not have a minimum withdrawal and maybe get rewards for the rewarded coins one gets. Besides these things that some wouldn't consider minor, the service is a decent staking and masternode service. I do enjoy the giveaways that they have once in a while. Thank you","The app isn't too bad. It lacks all the features you'll find on the website, but it keeps up. This app is pretty much unlike most others in terms of crypto currencies. They offer you airdrops left and right and all sorts of ways to earn. There are some downsides. My KYC verification took about 20 tries. I'm not sure why, but it did eventually go through. If you are looking for an app that will reward you for staking crypto this one will do it. Just be alert that you'll need to stake ~$100 worth of whatever it is you are staking, or you won't be able to withdraw it until it hits that level. The APR earnings are just ridiculously high so it's definitely worth investing some time and effort into. I'll be using them for a a while.","Unexpectedly robust app! Walked through the app for to login and check the mobile UI. Perfect and Very tidy! But it would be more entertaining and not boring if you guys add some twist on it, some rewarding game/s, maybe spin the wheel, some scratching games, or coin prediction. As a user and money making online hunter, that is a ++ bonus. Or daily check in that rewards that makes us go check the app daily. :)"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.mycontainer","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mycontainer&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Ripple Wallet.

Have $350 in there now that was deposited almost a month ago they won't let me deposit saying I need to wait 4 days. Support responded to my first 2 emails then haven't helped or said anything for at least a week now. I can not stress this enough, DO NOT TRUST THIS EXCHANGE IF YOU VALUE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!","Placed an order yesterday (7/1) for $500 US. Total amt withdrawn is $1000. I email customer support. They say apologies but we ran your transaction twice by mistake. It will take 3 to 7 business days to be back in your account. I then check my bank account today (7/2) and there is another $500 withdrawn!! Uphold now has $1000 of my money. I'm not in the business of giving out interest free loans! Update (7/6): They still have my funds. Have not heard back from Customer Support. Ticket #1472878","Very high network fee, and no way to use lower fee for smaller transactions. Litecoin transactions cost an arm & a leg. Plus they won't let you connect you to more than 4 brave browsers, and no way to detach browsers no longer in use.","This uphold app & company is a Scam.look at the lowest rated reviews that will give you an accurate representation of one's experience. I've encountered technical difficulties as other users, unexpectedly account deactivated/closed. I have funds held which they will not return or activate account to allow me to transact. Uphold is very limited, I only used to purchase stable coins & move to more stable and flexible wallet. Uphold doesn't like that & will restrict access.

Merging the digital world with the physical world makes this an app that is both profitable and fun! I highly recommend grabbing the Sentinel Card since it's free for now (except shipping). If you're frequently on the road this could be a serious side hustle! If you're not, it's still fun, lucrative, and free!","Since the last update my coin map is stock on loading, this update is bad. New update: I later figure out that my location was turn off and the app fail to inform me, secondly getting a decent amount without upgrading is impossible, sadly the upgrade is expensive especially for people who aren't daily drivers. It is pretty much waste of time if you aren't a premium member and a driver.","Fun. Free basic plan is slow but it's worth it for the premium plans as you do usually make more than the subscription cost if you remember to use it everytime you're out and about ( gets easy ). Sentinel is on its way and may help with that, will update once I know. Update ~ sentinel helps alot! Recommend 100%. High paying surveys are broken! Please fix. Surveys are 90% broken now. Review is reflecting the problems.","I like the ability to mine coin, but I'm not liking the SentinelX card. It won't let my other apps operate when it's being detected. Won't let reward videos play.. Causes my phone to lose GPS location while using Google maps. Also, for 35 dollars for the card and a pro membership, I'm still getting the same coin rewards from mining that I was with just a pro account. Also, why can I link my coinbase wallet, but can't buy xyo coin on coinbase?","Great fun! Likes newer phones 7 series or newer. Just noticed my review from almost two years ago. Wow have we come along way!! If I'm moving, I'm mining. Mine them coins and convert them to tokens. Never thought this would pay off the way it has. We are still climbing and and I'm excited for the future. Play and learn. Get yourself a crypto wallet and redeem every chance you get.

It a great way to keep a general idea of what's going on without having to sit down with my spreadsheets. Unfortunately it doesn't update well and the open trades from most exchanges won't show up. If they do, it's only for BTC. Love this app, don't get me wrong. It's just needs some improvement and I cannot wait for it. (Paid user)","Overall great app and easy to use. But there is a bug in the Custom Alert when you edit the notes in what Coin and save it, the notes from other Coin appears to a different Coin. So I have to refresh it or go to a different tab then switch back to make it look how it should be. I also hope to have an option to add a device since I use two devices to keep track the whole day. There is also some needs for improvement when updating the main, and including graphs in the widget.","I used the free version for a couple of days, and felt like the pro would have some edge. Boy, how wrong was I, it's fantastic! You can connect it to all your wallets, exchanges, websites, etc. And have a holistic view of detailed one on your cryptos and portfolio. Now I can easily know, where I'm losing or making money. I highly recommend this app. Worth every penny, especially if you consider the competition that offers less of more money.","Really great app! I like the ability to get a complete view of my portfolios without having to go to each individual exchange app. The daily (customizable time) report is really cool too! I've been using it for around 4 months now without any issues. I highly recommend CoinStats!!! 👍","My sister likes this app so I thought I'd try it. She has an Apple phone & her app alerts settings offers a sound option so she uses \"Choo choo\" sound to not miss any alerts. I have a Samsung Note 20 Ulltra but the app doesn't offer any sound options. We're both using free option so far. Does anyone know why? 3 stars because of this but I'll update if resolved."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.coinstats.crypto.portfolio","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coinstats.crypto.portfolio&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Freewallet: Bitcoin & Crypto Blockchain Wallet","description":"Multi Crypto Wallet is the cryptocurrency wallet that has several millions of users worldwide.

All very confusing. We will see. [edit#3]. They eventually refunded me, however based on this experience I still cannot recommend nor give > 2 stars - especially when they ask me to edit the review.

Update: 12 hour run time for .7 Tron is not worth the time. When it was on 10 minute cycle time we at least got a decent amount of coin for our efforts. We now get 1.4 Tron for 24hrs of mining.

Playtime was brilliant. I hardly change the device because the other one had a problem. This was said on both devices at once: this is not compatible with my device. 5 minutes before there were no problems. Even after I reset the cache and the GAID, it is not possible the support just says that my phone is not compatible. 5 minutes before everything works, you are simply fobbed off, and that after 4-5 days until you get an answer in support gets a shame. And i see it coming an standard answer here who says plz reset the GAID and Cache -.- or plz contact our support (that what i have done before i make the review.","This is one of the better sites to make a few dollars. They pay very well (relatively) to play their app games. I admit the games are just boring luck based ones, but still, they pay pretty well. The hourly roll for free coin is more data intensive than other apps and the capcha is a bit of a pain, but it's free. I also like the idea that they pay interest if you have 35k coin balance. I've made about $10 in coin in two weeks.","Great site, I just wish the surveys were more available to get. *edit: Thanks for the response :D another great reason to like this site!. I was just getting a lot of sad face emojis & \"this survey isn't for you\" Everything else seems so well balanced and even entertaining, keep up the great work!","This WAS a great app until the survey issues (see previous review) but hey, the games were working great until about 10 minutes ago when I took a break and now can't play them anymore due to \"device not supported\". Are you kidding me?? I was literally JUST playing without any issues!!! Fix this problem ASAP so I can get back to earning!!

The only issue that is giving me problems is that you must exit the app in order to open the authenticator app to plug-in a code and receive a pin#. You then open Bitstamp to enter the pin#.

I would give it 5 stars but the graph data is almost always wrong. Sometimes it's off just a bit and other times it's off a lot. Like today, graphs shown next to each coin show a sharp, temporary dip but when you go into that coin to view the graph, it does not show that dip.","This app couldn't be better. One thing that I love about this app is that it doesn't require you to log in or sign up as I'm using it only to check the prices of some coins that I have purchased from a different app. The widget is lovely and the numbers are clear and I love its ability to give notifications once a coin reaches a certain amount. Removing the ads is worth your two dollars. All in all, PERFECT! 👏","This is the best functionality of all the ones I've tried, however, it is a bit buggy. Sometimes the coins on the widget disappear and you have to hit refresh. Not a big deal but it does happen. Also, sometimes when I click on a coin in the widget and it opens in the app, it opens to the last thing I was looking at and not that coin. I'd be happy to work with support.","Everything is great, I also bought the ad free pro version. Just one BIG downside in widget, I'm not able to find any option for auto refresh (pro versions in few crypto apps do offer a feature where widget prices refresh automatically within the time interval you select). I know it can affect battery life, but i hope you can offer an upgrade with that feature with user having a choice to keep it off, or select auto refresh intervals like 2, 5, 10 mins, etc. Else it was 5 star for me","Ads are too frequent unless you pay. I had to edit as the developers think we are slow and don't understand the obvious. Devs - we know you want money and don't care about the people who use your software for free, but this is where your customer base comes from.

One of the most notable things recently is that even though Bitcoin had a huge selloff and price reduction recently these guys were able to see it coming and reallocate the funds they had me invested in and my investment avoided being a part of the selloff.

You loose. When you want to set a limit order, it gives you EUR currency, but I want to set in USD! Since I trade BTC/USD, not BTC/EUR! When you buy crypto, app buys it higher than standard market price, possible they create price gap + app takes big commission. Limit orders are very inconvenient and useless.","Would be better if it supported deposits and withdrawals with all the currencies it offers and not just 4 or 5, but the fees for sending/withdrawing bitcoin are a total rob so I don't know if I'd even use it.

In terms of Return (ROI) their rates are acceptable which provides another way of earning in the crypto space aside from trading. More power SOS!","This is a great app. Basically it is a staking service. You send your crypto on here and get revenue from staking and masternode rewards. One thing I really like about this app is that you get a portion of all the stakes and all masternode rewards based as soon as you deposit. The support is quick and profession. It's a really well done app and service.","I've been using SoS for some months and love the platform. Since the development of mobile app, it has been an awesome experience. Love the UI.

However, due to an issue with the mobile version of metamask I cannot log in to Shopping.io and connect my wallet. I have contacted their customer support and they have exhausted their ability to do anything in the matter as it appears to be a bug in metamask's mobile version itself.

Cant figure this out.","MetaMask is a great crypto wallet, makes swaps easy to do without going through all the swap providers individually. I think the negative reviews here are from a lack of understanding on how to use MetaMask, such as adding tokens so your balance shows then.

I also don't understand why the web version has a totally different cx compared to mobile. On mobile, I have a hard time setting a limit price and the cursor won't select the limit price text box. Not to mention the lack of basis portfolio visualization features and the fact we have two different apps from the same company.","Very disappointing app. I thought pro meant it was going to give me a lot of control over charts and indicators, but it's way too basic. I tried Binance and it provides a rich experience with a lot of customizability. I can actually zoom in and out and drag charts around, rather than this which is just fixed. Not trader friendly at all.","Absolutely horrible platform! I had $110 in Eth and tried to withdrawal some to pay someone. Turns out the authenticator had issues, I had to get my account unlocked, now I can't withdraw my money. Customer service is non-existent with coin base either. I can't reach anyone and my support tickets continue to get rejected. If I could speak with someone that could help me resolve this issue then i would be ok with the situation. Do yourself a favor and use another platform like Gemini or binance.","Garbage! Constantly freezing, especially when switching between apps. Constantly getting logged out and when I try to log back in I get a rate limit exceeded message that even by changing password I still can't log in and get same error, waited about an hour, uninstalled and still no progress. Trying to log on through web browser and it just loads and loads with the same stupid blue lines just chilling in the middle of the screen with no progress. This happens often, I regret transfer my funds","Used to be good. Now it doesn't even load past the title screen. Desktop app doesn't load at all. It's been almost a week and I can't get a reply from anybody for customer support, so I guess that's goodbye to my $2000. Wouldn't recommend using this app unless you're okay with having your money stolen. Will be taking legal action soon if this isn't resolved."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.coinbase.pro","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coinbase.pro&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Coinomi Wallet :: Bitcoin Ethereum Altcoins Tokens","description":"The blockchain wallet trusted by millions. \r\n\r\nSecurely store, manage, and exchange Bitcoin, Ethereum, and more than 1,770 Tokens and Altcoins.\r\n\r\nNative support for over 125 blockchains, including:\r\n\r\nBitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin SV, Litecoin, Binance Coin, Monero, Tron, Ethereum Classic, Dash, NEM, ZCash, Doge, Decred, Bitcoin Gold, Algorand, MonaCoin, Horizen, DigiByte, Komodo, Verge, ZCoin, Aion, Stratis,  Syscoin, PIVX, Vertcoin, Einsteinium, NavCoin, SmartCash, Peercoin, LBRY Credits, Viacoin, FIO and many more.\r\n\r\nSupport for every asset on Ethereum (ERC20/223/723), Omnilayer, NEM (Mosaics), BNB (BEP2) and Tron (TRC10), including:\r\n\r\nChainLink, Compound, Aave, Elrond, Kava, BAT, Ren, Yfi, Zrx, Band, Augur, Enjin, MCO, Aelf, Status, Matic and many more.\r\n\r\nA growing list of natively supported Stablecoins including:\r\n\r\nTether, Carbon, Maker, Gemini, Paxos, Reserve, Stable, Stasis, Synthetix, TrustToken, Circle and many more.\r\n\r\nSupport for major testnets such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin and Monero Stage.\r\n\r\nKEY FEATURES\r\n\r\n•Superb Security: Your private keys never leave your device.

Heartily Recommend.","Overall. Great! Only 2 small issues since having the app and now on my desktop. I couldn't do 5 ⭐ because the app and desktop are usually never synced together. The app shows one amount and PC a totally different amount even if I was to sync them at the exact time. That's probably my biggest issue. Other than that an awesome and secured wallet. Oh and it would be nice for the tokens to be updated and not have to manually put them in. That's all...","The pin security doesn't work! I lock my screen, unlock and the app is still open. What's the point in even having a pin set if you don't all for it?","I tried 20+ wallet and this is the best one. Caters both to advanced users and beginners alike, well organized and nice to look at. Most wallet software feels like either a hobby project or designed in a dungeon.

The integrated blog is well written and gives useful updates on the app and general news relevant to investors. Easy read. I recommend this to cryptocurrency beginners especially. I found Luno from their ads around London and am now applying for a job with them!","Luno is a good, reliable, and efficient application. The only things I'm not happy about is that i get charged for almost every transaction I make(no matter how small), and I was hoping that a Demo account system could be implemented for the exchange. I would really appreciate it if there was also Ripple(XRP) Saving wallets. Please please please add an XRP savings wallet","been observed for 2 month for this app.the system have some cheating algorithm when you buy and sell from luno. e.g when you buying btc, the rate is expensive RM142,828 and when you quickly want to sell btc, at same time,same second(without price market change significantly at all) rate become cheaper, which is RM142,135.i have tested back n forth for many time with constant market rate, still same/not close. dont try to order me contact support or what bcoz nothing to report, this is cheating.","Usage has been smooth for some months now, until recently... I lost my device and got a new one. All efforts to login with my details have been ineffective. I mean, you guys have my email address and phone number, why so difficult to redeem my account when I have assets in there?","I love this app, it is to easy to use and user friendly.

I hope you can fix this and overall it is a good app not great.","This has got to be the worst crypto wallet I've ever used. Tons of bugs and glitches, complicated staking procedures, and the fees are very high. On top of that I lost coins due to a problem with the wallet and customer service is simply incapable of understanding my problem or helping. My advice would be to stay away from this app.","Works well for me and I do recommend. Sometimes it takes a little time for transactions to go through but this is true for most transactions of this type. One thing to makes sure is you keep enough etherum to pay for the transaction if that is what is used for the fees. So just don't zero it out is what I am saying.","Great app for a beginner, such as myself. More up and coming coins need to be added. The ability to sell and trade coins directly thru the wallet would make it the best on the market. And if you really want to solidify #1 spot, bring the community of AWC users together like they've done on my favorite trading platform.","Great app, easy to use. So many nice features. Could use some added features. It's hard to know what your total returns on investments is since it doesn't keep track of where you stared. Haven't had great success in identifying if I've made anything on my staking crypto either.

Now it's only super inflated Bitcoin where earnings are so low that you couldn't afford even a can of beans after what you would make in a month's time. Not too happy but devs use this comment and take it as a learning experience. Fix your app. You will have my patience and kindness.","Not bad for the type of app it is. Avoid Pollfish surveys as they will lead you through a full length survey then not reward anything. InBrain surveys are hit or miss whether they reward anything at all leading them to be a time sink. Theorem Reach surveys will typically award at least something. The other app related opportunities pretty much don't reward anything. Update: seems all the surveys are now done by Lucid, which requires a lot of unnecessary cookies allowing them to track too much.","3 stars - I've had a lot of fun in the past year with this app, I've made over 50$ btc in my free time playing games, just make sure whichever offer wall you use has a customer support section.

The app is clean & functional. However, for over a month now they have blocked me from withdrawing dogecoin due to \"technical issues\" that they are unwilling to elaborate on. Everyone's suspicion is that they are insolvent, or, at the very least, manipulating the market. And to make matters worse, tickets go unanswered and when you question them about it on Telegram and Reddit, they block you.","Don't ever go with this exchange. I'm unable to login with 2FA as I changed my phone. Even after providing all the information over the mail thread started with the ticket, I'm not getting any response. I fear I would ever get singed into my account. Ticket#787115 Update: when I posted this, their team immediately replied this review pretending they care about their customers. But still no response to the ticket and my all money is lost. This is a real scam.","Worst experience using this app, they charge you ridiculous fees for withdrawal and the platform itself is stupid as it has no wallet so you need to have another wallet if you wish to take your own money out (whatevers left of it after theyve taken their massive cut) and yes they will claim they charge this fees for a safe transaction but others also have safe transactions but you dont see them overcharging!! Please do not use this!!","Worst crypto app. Trying for a month and half to restore my 2-FA due to device loss and still no answer from support. Provided everything they asked for: ID, contract hash numbers, and verification selfie. Not a word since. Strongly suggest to keep your funds away. Ticket is 760248- please release my account.","Horrible app extremely high fees even though it's flat but still it's higher than any app I've used. Withdrawal is a nightmare. Don't bother replying with the bot here 'we are sorry bla bla bla ' yet you ain't doing nothing because of your horrible customer service.

I've had a terrible time with this wallet. I brought virtual assets weeks ago and tried transferring them to the wallet and encountered issues with Bitrue. So far they've made me so a video of me signing in, and have all my confidential information and have yet to accredit the assets. They take days to respond and and haven't supplied any real solutions. Would not recommend, worst wallet available.","They're listing like 20 coins every week all stuff that people ask them to support. wish binance did that, you'll only be successful if you listen to your customers!!! They surely listen to the customers since you can see it by them listing new coins every damn week!! Aaanndd it also enabling me to purchase coins directly using credit card. Overall I have a very nice experience!!","I love the app cause I can get coins where I can't get else where But it would seem that they like to list new coins when there at there all time highs and kinda makes me feel they are involved with a little market manipulation. I do like the functionality of the app, but just be careful.","One of the worst apps I have utilized and totally worthless! I too am getting the server error at login. I transferred some USDT & when I try to exchange it for coins, I get a message indicating that I don't have enough funds. I'm not trying to purchase more than I have available. In order to transfer my money back to my wallet, I have to add more funds to get to the minimum transfer amount! Don't waste your time or money on a worthless app!!!","Very confusing app!

Disappointing and have switched to using the Fidelity app which provides the same features I was looking for without the ads. Just because the app is FREE doesn't justify full screen advertisements. There are plenty of free apps that are able to deliver advertising in a less obtrusive manner.","App seems ok but not used for long. Almost immediately after installing the app I had a cold call to my mobile and then received an email. Both from the company running the app. I'd only downloaded it to check the price and ask for an alert on some specific shares ( the only ones I own). Not impressed on how they exploited my contact details. I have uninstall the app.","Would be a more usefull tool if, when minimised, the app would stay in my minimised views section on my phone. It does not, it disappears as soon as I view anything else and, when I minimise that , to re-view investing app...the page has gone and I then have to go and re-start investing app and wait for yet another ad to load (which I, and almost everyone I know closes right away anyway) and then find what I was looking at before. In a trading situation, that is highly unfavourable. More work","Love the UI, push notifications are really meaningful, do not waste my time, the frequency is just right, helps quickly decide if I want to read the article in detail or just move on. Thanks to the Product, design and dev teams!","I think that this app is very useful. But, because my vision isn't what it used to be, I have my phone's font set as slightly larger than normal. This greatly affects the aesthetics of the app in a negative way. I made it smaller, so it could be beautiful, but it slightly strains my eyes to look at it.

All of this is hypersonic transactions so no excuse for slowing payment in my opinion. I paid for next level above free hoping it would make it more reliable, I was wrong.","Well to be honest, I don't want to rate this app just one star but because I have problems with my three requests and I emailed them to help but all they do is just tell me to wait for 15 days and I waited it for a couple months but nothing happened. Well don't download it you aren't can I get anything from them. I would come back to rate this app better if they can help but I guess not I've been with it for too long.","Whole thing is a fraud. Count resets, they don't pay. I've got 3 payments pending going on 3 weeks. Nothing but Hasbin crooked so called development team, couldn't get anything right! A certain quantum program coming will set things straight. They even try to put the old review on, the laughter will come as the encryption is torn apart. Or you're busted by cyber feds, either way.","Scam!!!! This app is not something you should use. I spent over 100 on app and I new something went wrong when the app stop working on me. I logged out and I try to talk to \"customer service\" and it they claimed to fix it. Go on their website and reverse search the photos of the founders of the app. Those images are used on other websites as well.","Started out good and reasonably easy to use. Had some Sat disappear assuming because I \"hadn't banked\". I put a withdrawal request in on the 19/06/21 which is still sitting as Pending, contacted customer service about a week later and have been waiting for a response since.

I really wanted to give 5 stars but the app failed to update after a recent transaction stating that I am offline. I found that I had to clear cache then restart, for it to work properly. Therefore only 4 stars for now. EDIT: after trying the built-in exchange I have removed another star from my review. Like others described before me the fees are higher than expected. DO NOT use the exchange service.","Easy to use, high transaction fees (but that's the bitcoin miner fee, it's the same no matter what wallet is used), only thing keeping it from being 5 stars is the fact that the minimum for exchanging altcoims is 52 euro which is quite high (as in, if I want to convert BTC to etherium, I have to convert a minimum of 52 euro worth) but overall a good, safe, easy to use app.","Wallet fees are ridiculous. Total Wallet amounts sometimes freeze so you have to reload multiple times for aggregate dollar amounts to show correctly. Ain't nobody got time for that foolishness. Update 5/5/2021: Based on feedback from Jaxx I will adjust my overall rating from 2 stars to 3 stars. If Jaxx can improve the crypto aggregate so that it's more reliable I will adjust my rating again. Thank you for your feedback. That piece of information you shared is helpful for my understanding.","Not good for new users. I tried to move and then trade around $400 USD of crypto coins and it says there is not enough money to do the transaction. The money is stuck there. This apparently this is nothing to do the makers of the wallet but they could have given some indication this was the case. I am new the crypto but I has no idea it costs more than $400 to move coins to another wallet or to an exchange.

The app is atrocious for shopping/browsing stores through the app. Can't get logged into some stores, can't navigate on others. Back button will have you starting over, etc.","It's a good concept, but the past few times I've played games to get rewards, the reward disappears before I'm able to complete it. It'll say in the rules \"within 20 days of installing\" and I'll go check on the status within 7, and the reward info isn't even available. This has happened to me twice. It doesn't even store it in my history. I'm frustrated.","Ordered some things on Aliexpress. At first, I thought it didn't work, but in a week or so the points showed up for my purchases. Good app, good concept. Can be improved, of course but going in the right direction.","Pretty cool to earn crypto rewards for shopping and playing games on ur phone! When I had an issue receiving a reward, customer service was responsive and resolved the issue quickly. Excites for the debit card launch!!!","So far it works for me as advertised, I find the browser extension easier to shop with but the phone app is nice for quick things.

Interest rates are quite competitive and having a lot of options is nice: earn in kind/Nexo, hold Nexo loyalty levels, and a higher locked monthly rate.

However on the app store I am just rating the app and not the algorithm itself, and I can say that there's a huge room for improvement. The only useful actions you can do on the app are to change the hedging and to contact support, I'd like to see more functions, options and statistics. App is slow, and takes a while (5 minutes?) just to show anything at all. Only some of the currencies have their own logo, the rest shows a purple dot.","App has too many bugs and the bot is not smart at all. I tested for 2 months and I basically didn't make a penny. If you want to use a bot Kucoin is your much better. Let me better explain: 1) Not able to see portfolio value because of a recurring that happens at least once in a week. 2) Portfolio value vs Binance value is not imdentical 3) Your bot does not have strategy for bear market. Yes you win in a bull market as you win on any other bot, nothing special about this.","Without going into too much detail, it is a good app. The foundation is in place, it is working and making profits, but on the other hand the experience is so raw and frustraiting. (Would be 5 starts when they get all the problems sorted out)","Signed up five days ago still not working. Customer support next to useless. App currently lagging ten hours behind. Trades not being made. Waste of time and money. A month on and app still not working. Now no trades for 3 days. Told I need 1000 in account but more than that in account. Full of excuses but no answers or solutions. Very poor app. Do not use.","Top Line - DO NOT USE if portfolio <5k based on 1 month exp Set-up and general app 1. The app is super laggy and does not update/sync with Binance. 2. The registration process was bad. Did everything requested by app and had follow up 2-3 days to make sure account became active 3. Customer is flaky and does not respond in time + no specific solution Trading - concept is nice execution is bad. Algo does NOT work for small portfolio (<2-5k).

However, there is an annoying announcement / ad banner at start of the app every time which can only be closed with the cross button situated at the top corner of the screen. Due to the large screen phones today, closing this banner requires a two hand manoeuvre which is really poor design according to me and is also annoying to be receiving the banner in the first place. Banners should be placed in a manner that is non-obtrusive and secondly user should be able.","Awesome. It's good that many coins are added, but it's confusing. Showing different page per currency isn't comfortable. There must a single page of all coins available with current prices and even columns with what we hold of them. And then when we touch the respective coin we could see history and price chart while whatever we hold too should be shown at once and total price of what we hold too. There were no such monthly charges when i was using wazirx earlier. This rule has come later.","1. App user interface is not intuitive. 2. While doing KYC if you accidently go back, you will need to refill the info. 3. Also if KYC rejected, whole form needed to be refilled. 4. Not sure where can we see price timeline for coins. It is very important to showcase that at very main screeen. 5. While adding INR money, options provided are only mobikwik even though it shows UPI verified.","Great. Very easy to understand and invest in crypto using this App. Best app out there in market for investing in crypto. Easy to navigate and very easy to understand and you can see prices of crypto updating every second. Much impressed with this app and withdraws and deposits are very easy in this app. The charts for each individual token/coin load very slow and sometimes non responsive with no axes labels. One cannot see the trend over time on the app easily. Wish we had more data and notes.","Really, amazing! This app only has a big name else than that there is nothing about it. About a month ago I placed an order for a shoe. And I received a different product then what i had ordered for, so the very same day I requested for a exchange. Unlike other shopping site Wazirx had quiet a complicated exchange process where in we need to provide all if proof and stuff. But as asked by Wazirx I emailed them my Adhar card as an ID proof and later again I sent my passport because Wazirx said."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.wrx.wazirx","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wrx.wazirx&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Bitcoin of America Wallet","description":"Total privacy and security in our easy to use blockchain wallet.

Its interface is easy to use. Great for beginners. I hope they add more coins in the future. Watch out when using the exchange. They won't return your tokens after cancellation. Beware.","Simple, clean, and source available. Beware, though. They claim only the minimum blockchain fees are assessed but the build distributed here charges multiple doge, sometimes tens or even hundreds, when Dogecoin famously only requires 1 doge for even large transactions. Where are these extra doge going? Are they going somewhere or are users simply forced to overpay? No option to edit fee. Strangely, it seems honest and correct for other coins. I use the langerhans wallet for Dogecoin anyway but it's frustrating because I'd like to recommend this one for general multi-coin use.","Says it converts DOGE, then doesn't let you. Transferred crypto over to it and now wasted a fee to do that and going to get charged for going somewhere else. This is a waste of your time, find another app, another site, anywhere that you can that will let you convert what you want to. Seems pretty dodgy to advertise something and then not do anything that you've said. The app is easy enough to use, and that's the only reason for not giving a 1, simple and basic, nothing to say there, but definitely not worth your time for trading.","Great app just having trouble getting a old account back as I don't know of the log in","Charged me a $10 fee for buying $30 of Bitcoin, then only alaws me to send half of what I put in.

I also wish I had the option to mine all 3 options at once even if this where an upgrade only feature. The name multi-mine lead me to believe I would have this ability, which is what drew me to the app originally. Def recommend!","So far I like the app. I upgraded to gold and it moves much faster!The speed is fine. Few things to read. You have to get verified and it can take up to 10 days however it stated you can request to send it through the platform to speed it up. Within that timline you'd have to wait to cash out which can take up to 5 business days. I read how to avoid losing Satoshi bc it is how the user manipulate the app opposite of what the developers recommendation bc support helped me with the issue.","Great mining App, I've mined before, weeks on end, month after month, after 90 days I couldn't even visit the dollar store. This app is legit, you spend 20 1ce and easily make 80, I always forget about my phone and app stuff. I like doing real things, hardly turning it on I make a 400% profit. Il invest the total $120 next time I bet It would make new car payments for me","Lost BCH, around 17,000. Will update if fixed. Update, still not fixed and now missing even more from the btc tab. Will update if fixed. Email many times, messaged from the dashboard on website and put in multiple requests for missing Satoshi and not fixed. They keep taking the Satoshi that their customers accumulate on their app. You build up 10,000 plus sat on any or multiple tabs on the app one day it's gone. And they do not respond except to send you an email to update your wallet info. Scam","So. It's nice seeing numbers run at the toppa ya screen, but I been waiting for my “pending” request to be completed for about 14 days now. It's getting annoying. Also, if you think you can mine, while your phone is on standby, and by that I don't even mean closing the app, but just pushing the power button so the screen turns dark (but the phone's still on), you are terribly wrong!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.task.multimine","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.task.multimine&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Wirex Card & Multicurrency Crypto Wallet","description":"Save money with a banking alternative that gives you total control over your money.

I used to get notifications on my Price alerts and price changes in my watch list fine, with no problems. Now I don't get them anymore. In fact, when I click on the bell in the top right corner, there's a little comment that says \"turn on notifications for this app to start receiving notifications\".

The chart doesn't follow the market price anymore. Sometimes, the market price for a coin with be green in color but the chart for it will be red, and vice versa. 2. This app doesn't follow the rise and fall for coins. At times, a coin might rises with 340% but the app might falls to 98% or 70% or even 100%. 3. And now, as at today, 26th of June 2021, it doesn't even open up. It only throws an error.

On 14th I logged a bug problem. On the 16th I received an email from Juvi confirming problem resolved I checked and the app is working perfectly.

And then once I tried to verify it asked me if I wanted to use local data or account data. No idea what that means. All I know is that when somebody puts you through this much of a hassle just to create an account it probably isn't worth it, so I'm bucking this down to three stars.

Edit: I know that it's secure - too secure! My office got broken into and all my paperwork destroyed. Making excuses oppose to listening to those who use your app is just poor customer service and am now reducing my rating to 1 because of that.","My experience has been so good, i felt i needed to write a review for others who need a good wallet and cant decide based on others feedback. The app is so user friendly. Is very easy on the eyes. Is super quick. Ive downloaded close to 15 other wallet apps and with BRD i transferred in some BCH (bitcoin cash) the transfers were lightening speed. Literally in split seconds. And network fees $0.00. Wallet fees? $0.00. Yes it cost me absolutely nothing to send BCH in split seconds. I love it 5/5.","I tested this app when it first came out some years ago. Back then it was by far one of the best wallets available and it still is! Security is strong and it has a host of useful features such as the ability to import encrypted private keys from paper wallets you may have cold storage. It also allows you to sweep both BTC and bitcoin cash from wallets created pra to any forks. Don't be put off by some of the negative reviews, if you read them you will find most of them are unreasonable.","Pretty good app for the most part but sometimes you will get an error message when trying to trade between cryptos and it only give a error code and does not tell you what went wrong. Most of the ti.e it is because the app doesn't want you to transfer all of your coin to another coin. For ie. If I have $500 in BTC and want to put that all into ETH I will get an error code. Now if I leave $20 in my BTC and transfer the rest it works pretty good. Buy BRD coin you will save money in trading coin.","Horrible app for your crypto wallet. As soon as my last few transactions clear I am uninstalling. I have been using this app for over a year now and it has literally got worse over time. Transactions take forever for no reason.

You are not getting paid. 2) If/when the project goes live you will not be keeping your mined tokens. 3) The value of NBL if/when it goes live it highly unlikely to be pegged 1:1 with it's parent.

Is not even upto 10 or 15cent .... That is tooo poor considering the quality of the ad's and amount of ads we have to watch. Please us very very unfair. Am not happy at all this is not encouraging do something about it","It is a good free way to continuously get small amounts of Litecoin. I use the BCH app too & they r just alike, which isnt a bad thing. One improvement that could be made is in the Playwall offers...they pay good at the very first and then make u play more for less, which is backwards and make me delete games i actually liked in place for what will give more Litoshis. That could be improved...and a lot of the surveys could be too bc there's never any available and i rarely get to finish any .","App works ok but rewards are very poor and need a huge increase, 300 thousand litoshi is worth £0.30 (30 UK pennies) a 30 second add reward can earn you 100 litoshi, 15-20min surveys reward 2p and many of the surveys disqualify you or close when you're 98% complete so you get zero rewards many times. Bitlabs surveys lie and pay out 25% what they advertise at times","You won't make a ton of money but it is consistent . They also do double days. Compared to others I like how it is an actually unit. 4/8 I completed an offer but did not get anything. There are no answers Update 4/26 Playwall offer no longer works Update 5/4 I did get a response. I appreciate. I'm banned too for some reason, even though I used Google play. The developers don't control who is banned. It's the serves they use. Oh well","I've been having problems accessing the playtime offerwall since the last update. Nothing happen when i click on the link of the playtime offerwall. Have emailed the developer but no response. It used to be okay until the latest update.

The API key was an issue when I first downloaded months ago. Locked me out so I left it alone. Come back today.

The biggest things I'd like to see change in the future is not being able to conduct transactions in app, being limited to only wire transfers (and their fees) to fund the account and not listing newer alt coins. The minor change I'd like is the ability to view your investments instead entire market. Apart from the app, their customer service is top notch!","I like the layout and the easily accessible data that is available but freezes up at times forcing you to clear the app from recents and restarting. Has a tendency to just force close on you when you are either making a trade or selling or randomly asking for your password when you decide to make a transaction. Kinda annoying at times.

The PAMP token contract rewards holders when the price increases and penalizes sellers when it does not. \r\n\r\nOur new Web3 friendly encrypted mobile wallet is live on Mainnet with thousands of investors in the PAMP community. We make yield farming in DeFi super simple. Keep track of your PAMP balances, claim your staking rewards, check daily price action, plus so much more.

Rewards are distributed on a daily basis!\r\n\r\nIf the token price does not appreciate, no rewards are minted. Sellers who move their tokens around have their stakes reset, negating any bonus rewards they may receive when the token appreciates in value. \r\n\r\nIn addition, PAMP is deflationary, meaning that all token transfers have 8% of the transfer or sell burned. On negative days, this increases by 2% per day until the price is positive again. Holders are strongly incentivized to buy tokens and HODL as long as possible.\r\n\r\nFAQs\r\n\r\nHow do I claim my rewards?\r\nEvery day the price change is positive, simply navigate to the home screen of our mobile app or visit pamp.network/staking to claim your rewards. If you move or sell tokens, you will pay a fee of 8% and your staking time will reset, which will significantly decrease your rewards. If you receive 10% of your tokens (by purchasing them or otherwise having them transferred to you), your staking time will decrease by 1 day.\r\n\r\nWhat is the minimum staking amount?\r\nThe minimum amount to receive price-reactive staking rewards is 200 PAMP. For Uniswap liquidity staking, there is no minimum to stake and receive rewards.\r\n\r\nWho governs the Oracle?\r\nThe PAMP Network uses a backend service that queries Uniswap for pricing data three times a day and then updates the smart contract on Ethereum with the average percentage change. We are working on upgrading this service to query for the price once every hour. In the future we will use the Chainlink Oracle for decentralized price updates.\r\n\r\nWhat is Holder’s Day?\r\nOnce a month, usually at the end of the month, we activate Holder’s Day, which is a day that all holders of 30 days or more (as of this day) can get a nice bump in their rewards, regardless of price action. The current holder’s day reward formula is: tokens received = balance * (days staked / 600). \r\n\r\nHas the contract been audited?\r\nYes, we have successfully completed two security audits of our smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. You can view the detailed reports on our website.\r\n\r\nCOMING SOON\r\n\r\nOur mission is to become the best mobile wallet for staking in DeFi, so we also plan to add:\r\n\r\nTrading via Uniswap\r\nLiquidity staking\r\nFiat onboarding ramps (no need to leave the app)\r\n\r\nNEED MORE HELP?\r\nVisit our website for more information or contact our community support on social media:\r\n\r\nWebsite - Pamp.Network\r\nTwitter - @PampNetwork\r\nTelegram - t.me/PampNetwork\r\nMedium - @PampNetwork\r\nGithub - Pamp-Network\r\n\r\n\r\nPrivacy Policy: https://pamp.network/privacy.pdf","descriptionHTML":"Pamp Network is the first price-reactive decentralized finance project built on the Ethereum blockchain.

This app is really great (W72KJO). But it consume to much mobile data. I think it will be great if user could pick. Which video they want to see rather than playing all of them automatically. Maybe for some peoples might be not bothered with this issue, but i think there are other who have the same thinking with me, We really apreciate it if you would add an option ture off video autoplay. Hope you reach this review. Thanks a lot","In starting app was responding good. All af rewards all given full. But now they are not giving sharing rewards., and i am totally dispointed now most of the features are not working as video's are not running since one month. How do we play uncapibble game. Our time is wasting so money too., kindly fix the viedo problem.","i had been update to the last version, but still there are problems with the video reward, if the video with long duration and can be skip after a few second its still dont give rewards, and if i try watch video to get free spin it often can't play anything or if its played it dont give me free spin. shortly there are still a lot of problems with video rewards, for free spin or for free CCU. please fix it. it is really annoying.","Coinclub is very legit, just be patient. The withdrawal will come very soon. They really paid the previous bounty so I believe in coinclub. And they fixed so many bugs, they listen and care their member.
