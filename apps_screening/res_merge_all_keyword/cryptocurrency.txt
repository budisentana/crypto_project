This app is complete trash. I try to verify my account for the thousands time and I get an email that it is completed but on the app it says it failed. I cannot buy anything. I contacted the costumer service and haven't received anything yet. Also they don't have live agents to talk to what complicates things as well. In overall this app is completely worthless and I do not trust them to pay me out if I had money on my account due to the failure of their verification system.","TNT: Hello all, this the first time that I am rating on here. Cut to the chase, I'm noticing a lot lately that the biometric scanner is running slow or it isn't working majority of the time and as well as the the pencoode to login. Not, sure if you're squad is aware of this but it has been happening quite often. Can, this be fixed when the next update comes out. It, might just be me phone but I'd greatly appreciate it. Thank you.... Update: Still doing it!...","The app is great the support is non-existent. I put money in over 3 days ago and it came out of my checking account but I still can't invest anything even though the website and the application both say as soon as you make a deposit you can start investing you just can't withdraw the funds for 10 days. my money's been in the portfolio for 3 days! you can't get a hold of a real person they only do it electronically and i guess I'm just screwed. USE AT YOUR OWN PERIL!!","I gave this rating because their system locks my account because I don't always check the status of my account and when I try to reset my password and the something happens again I get locked. They don't answer the phone when I call. Now get this, you can use the same email address and password word and the system says they don't recognize my computer, email address or password. They also want me to use an email account I no longer can get into thanks to at&t. Reloading information does not wor","In my honest opinion about this app. I would say it's really cool to see the vast variety of cryptocurrencies that are out there. It is pretty easy to use. Now for the cons of this app. The app does run slow and act up sometimes. Also the huge fees the force on you everything you make any transaction between both sell and buying. So you lose a ridiculous amount of money. You can convert cryptocurrency into other cryptocurrency but there is a catch the convert it at a much lower rate!

In this update:<br>- Bug fixes &amp; improvements","comments":["I really enjoy the app! I use the card for purchases I would make like gas and snack food because you get a little CRO back so I thought why not. Buying coins is easy as well. The only part I don't really understand is the card tiers say you need a minimum staked in dollars to go up a tier, but then when I go to stake there is a minimum written in CRO or whatever other coin I've tried staking. Other than that I really enjoy the app and if you're wanting a debit card for crypto, this one works!","App is not incredibly intuitive, but it's still pretty solid. Only 3 stars because app doesn't work at all in newest version of Android beta, which is currently preventing me from accessing my investments. Reduced another star (now 2) as it's not been a month since the Android 12 beta went public and has even had an update, but this app has still not been fixed. It's the only app that I've encountered that does not work in the beta.","I purchased crypto worth $3,520. I was showing this amount but when the transaction complete I was charged a fee even though it did not show the box where I have to check it and agree to the fee. I contact customer service many times but no luck I told them it was a glitch on their end but the customer service is like a robot.. they just copy and paste.. total scam I do not recommend it. I am in a process to cancel my account.","This is the most complicated app I've ever dealt with for crypto buying selling and tracking. It's takes forever, selling and trading is extremely confusing. Only reason I am using it is ability to buy diverse coins. 1 star is very harsh, but its obvious this app is designed for the educated when it comes to crypto, people new to crypto currency would be better served going somewhere else. Trading, buying, or transferring needs to be made more simple .","Overall the app is nice, that is if you get to open it! I've been using it for 6m now and would like to see faster replies from the customer service agents and limit orders when buying coins. Ah, I didn't get my referral credit too. A bit more generous rewards for staking would be appreciated too. Other than that, it has a nice selection of coins and it's quite easy to use."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"co.mona.android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.mona.android&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Crypto App - Widgets, Alerts, News, Bitcoin Prices","description":"Keep track of all crypto coins in one app!

Best crypto widgets (come with the app). The only feature I wish for would be a year long chart widget. I know this sounds unnecessary because yesterday's year-long chart will be similar to today's and tomorrow's, and because many people have a mental image of the last year. However, for myself, it's easy to forget exactly when things happened 8 or 9 months ago, & that's important for seasonal trends. I can look it up, & just remember, but I end up w/ a static image in mind.","An amazing app for both news and keeping up with crypto prices. The choice of alarm settings are great and the widgets that come along with the app are useful too. Highly advise buying the pro version. You get what you pay for with it.","I mainly use the app for the widgets on my homescreen, to get a quick look. This used to work like a charm. Now the widgets don't update anymore for like a week already. Fix this and you'll get 5 stars.","The (less than<) function for the alarms I set stopped working. Only notified for the (greater than >) ones. Emailed company twice with no response or fix. I see another person had this issue also. Was working fine until a month ago.","Advised that the wallet will cease to exist soon, recommended to move my funds. I can't withdraw the funds using the same card that I bought the Bitcoin with because it's a Visa, but I also cannot transfer the currency because my total doesn't meet the minimum transfer amount.

And why we have 2 apps, normal and pro. Just integrate both in one app and user should be able to choose the normal or pro layout just like other exchange.

Half a year later, I feel a need to update this review but unfortunately I can't give more than 5 stars. In the beginning I screwed up two times with my fiat fundings. I thought I lost that money, but when I reached out to Kraken support they fixed it in less than two days. Very friendly and patient employees 💎✨👑","One thing I really miss is a little indicator next to my coins that shows the change in their value as a percentage compared to my initial investment (ex. +3,6% compared to when I bought the coin). Honestly, I don't understand how is this not a feature already, literally every other crypto and stock exchange has this. Otherwise it's great so far.","I'm genuinely shocked at how basic this app is. It's meant to be one of the most established exchanges, but the functionality of this app is way behind any others I've used. There's no ability to search, and cryptos aren't listed alphabetically, so it's difficult to find anything. No price alerts either. I can only assume a browser based version is far better.","This app requires me to remove and register my bank constantly. Advice from support was to just keep reconnecting it. But I am limited to 5 bank connects within a 30 day period. Great advice... 😑. Something todo with a timeout from my bank. Well, yeah you don't keep the connection open unless you are buying. If it's trustly's error then switch to plaid Gemini works just fine, no issues whats so ever. If Gemini added Cardano to their platform.

The only option given is international money wire!.This takes days, and your charged a fair amount to transfer YOUR money to YOUR account! Considering they already take a cut from every coin purchase and sale, this is just shocking. Taking YOUR money out should not be this expensive.","App has been very slow and buggy lately. ** ** *update* As per the developer's suggestion I've refreshed the app by uninstalling and reinstalling it. I Added 1 star because it is much better now but it's still not as fast as it should and another star for great customer support. I appreciate the app very much as it is very helpful to keep track of my crypto assets. Hopefully with the next update I can give it 5*.","The buttons are unresponsive, and there is a long lag time. I often have to open and close the app just to get it responsive again. Also, when scrolling between portfolios, the process lags as well with a blank screen coming up when I try to scroll between portfolios instead of seeing the actual portfolio. This is highly frustrating. I would like a developer to please get in contact with me. Having to tap these buttons 10x over for just one action is really grating. Awful user experience.","Be warned: They double charged me for one deposit. And they STILL have not fixed the problem for me 2 months later. They refer me to their financial company whom then gives me the run around. Eventually they said a refund was coming but it never came. They seem very unorganized at best, and possibly fraudulent at worst. I will not be depositing another dollar into this company. I do NOT recommend them to any new users. You've been warned.","I would have to say that Blockfolio is the worst. For 3 months I've tried too get help with my account and the error codes on my account and still haven't received any help. I've tried to withdraw both cryptocurrency and USD coins and it will not let me. I've reached out to support on that as well and again, NO HELP. Anyone who has an account with Blockfolio or is thinking about getting one, I would SERIOUSLY recommend against it."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.blockfolio.blockfolio","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blockfolio.blockfolio&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"CoinGecko - Bitcoin & Cryptocurrency Price Tracker","description":"Bitcoin and cryptocurrency data, real time prices, market cap, portfolio, widgets, news and alerts by the world’s leading independent cryptocurrency data aggregator.\r\n\r\n 🔥 Our FREE crypto price tracker app allows you to:\r\n🍬 NEW: Collect free daily candies to redeem exclusive rewards - NFTs, vouchers, discounts and more!\r\n❖ Access real-time market data for Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Dogecoin, Binance Coin, Litecoin, and over 7000+ cryptocurrencies\r\n❖ Build your own Portfolio and Track real-time Profit & Losses\r\n❖ Set personalized price alerts with large market movement alerts\r\n❖ Widgets for you to track crypto prices on your homescreen\r\n❖ Track Crypto Derivatives such as Perpetual and Futures Contracts\r\n❖ Stay up to date with trending crypto news by top news outlets\r\n❖ Instant Calculator for over 30+ currencies including fiat & cryptocurrencies\r\n\r\n✔ Track 7000+ Crypto Prices Worldwide\r\n- Real time pricing data, trading volume, market capitalization, Trust Score, historical price chart and exchanges volume for over 7000+ cryptocurrencies.\r\n- Connected to 400+ exchanges worldwide such as Binance, Coinbase Pro, FTX, Bitfinex, Uniswap, Pancakeswap, Kraken, Huobi, Kucoin and more\r\n- Supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Binance Coin, Dogecoin, Polygon/Matic, Polkadot, Uniswap, Aave, Sushi, SNX, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Cardano, Tron, Monero and more (over 7000+ cryptocurrencies)!\r\n- Meme coins are all the rage these days.

Very irritating and frustrating","The latest update today is showing ad before every single page that you go through in the app. If it is only during first launch of the app, it is ok but ad before switching to every page within the app?!! Seriously? Once it is fixed, I will change my rating.","They should really find a solution for your chart settings. Every week they give an update. Every week all your settings are gone. Tradingview for the win! Custommer support not reachable. i tried to reach them for 6 weeks, 3 seperate complaints. 2 sessions attemps on the chat. 50 emails. We still arent any further.

It a great way to keep a general idea of what's going on without having to sit down with my spreadsheets. Unfortunately it doesn't update well and the open trades from most exchanges won't show up. If they do, it's only for BTC. Love this app, don't get me wrong. It's just needs some improvement and I cannot wait for it. (Paid user)","Overall great app and easy to use. But there is a bug in the Custom Alert when you edit the notes in what Coin and save it, the notes from other Coin appears to a different Coin. So I have to refresh it or go to a different tab then switch back to make it look how it should be. I also hope to have an option to add a device since I use two devices to keep track the whole day. There is also some needs for improvement when updating the main, and including graphs in the widget.","I used the free version for a couple of days, and felt like the pro would have some edge. Boy, how wrong was I, it's fantastic! You can connect it to all your wallets, exchanges, websites, etc. And have a holistic view of detailed one on your cryptos and portfolio. Now I can easily know, where I'm losing or making money. I highly recommend this app. Worth every penny, especially if you consider the competition that offers less of more money.","Really great app! I like the ability to get a complete view of my portfolios without having to go to each individual exchange app. The daily (customizable time) report is really cool too! I've been using it for around 4 months now without any issues. I highly recommend CoinStats!!! 👍","My sister likes this app so I thought I'd try it. She has an Apple phone & her app alerts settings offers a sound option so she uses \"Choo choo\" sound to not miss any alerts. I have a Samsung Note 20 Ulltra but the app doesn't offer any sound options. We're both using free option so far.

I would give it 5 stars but the graph data is almost always wrong. Sometimes it's off just a bit and other times it's off a lot. Like today, graphs shown next to each coin show a sharp, temporary dip but when you go into that coin to view the graph, it does not show that dip.","This app couldn't be better. One thing that I love about this app is that it doesn't require you to log in or sign up as I'm using it only to check the prices of some coins that I have purchased from a different app. The widget is lovely and the numbers are clear and I love its ability to give notifications once a coin reaches a certain amount. Removing the ads is worth your two dollars. All in all, PERFECT! 👏","This is the best functionality of all the ones I've tried, however, it is a bit buggy. Sometimes the coins on the widget disappear and you have to hit refresh. Not a big deal but it does happen. Also, sometimes when I click on a coin in the widget and it opens in the app, it opens to the last thing I was looking at and not that coin. I'd be happy to work with support.","Everything is great, I also bought the ad free pro version. Just one BIG downside in widget, I'm not able to find any option for auto refresh (pro versions in few crypto apps do offer a feature where widget prices refresh automatically within the time interval you select). I know it can affect battery life, but i hope you can offer an upgrade with that feature with user having a choice to keep it off, or select auto refresh intervals like 2, 5, 10 mins, etc. Else it was 5 star for me","Ads are too frequent unless you pay. I had to edit as the developers think we are slow and don't understand the obvious. Devs - we know you want money and don't care about the people who use your software for free, but this is where your customer base comes from. Amazon isn't huge because poor customer service to people who don't buy a lot."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.supercrypto.cryptocyrrency","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.supercrypto.cryptocyrrency&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Crypto News","description":"Crypto News is a useful application for crypto enthusiasts.

I think they need to make it more clear that those arrows on the side are the send and receive buttons. I think they should also display your balance first before they show the price of the cryptocurrency. What I mean is that instead of having to switch to see your balance I think you should have to switch to see the price of what ever cryptocurrency you are on. Other than those two things the app is amazing! 😄👏🏼","This wallet is all we need. More and more coins are added and the best part is that this wallet is user friendly. I highly suggest to use their desktop wallet for best experience. Their support is also superb. I can still remember when I had some issues with my deposits way back in 2017, they were helpful and very professional. Keep it up exodus, cheers!","Slider shows wrong value when you are at 6 months scope - how can be peak of a price graph be 30 while the dip is 50? I do remember when I bought but it is about money it really shouldn't show wrong values. Nice design. I would like to see auto note about price when I did recive or send. And my average - just a lil bit of analytics. ( any price graph has this bug - it is more apparent with scope 1+ month)","The app is indeed very convenient; its design is well suited for everyday crypto needs, however the problem on my phone (which is running Android 8.1) is that the app requires more CPU and RAM resources than the phone is okay dealing with, which results in a significant delay when loading the UI screen for each requested functionality; in short - it's slow. Other than that it's a great tool to have. For legit advice on acquiring Bitcoin with zero investment see cb.run/earn-bitcoin-free","Exodus is by far the best wallet when it comes to UI/UX.

I would really appreciate it if there was also Ripple(XRP) Saving wallets. Please please please add an XRP savings wallet","been observed for 2 month for this app.the system have some cheating algorithm when you buy and sell from luno. e.g when you buying btc, the rate is expensive RM142,828 and when you quickly want to sell btc, at same time,same second(without price market change significantly at all) rate become cheaper, which is RM142,135.i have tested back n forth for many time with constant market rate, still same/not close. dont try to order me contact support or what bcoz nothing to report, this is cheating.","Usage has been smooth for some months now, until recently... I lost my device and got a new one. All efforts to login with my details have been ineffective. I mean, you guys have my email address and phone number, why so difficult to redeem my account when I have assets in there?","I love this app, it is to easy to use and user friendly.

However, there is an annoying announcement / ad banner at start of the app every time which can only be closed with the cross button situated at the top corner of the screen. Due to the large screen phones today, closing this banner requires a two hand manoeuvre which is really poor design according to me and is also annoying to be receiving the banner in the first place. Banners should be placed in a manner that is non-obtrusive and secondly user should be able.","Awesome. It's good that many coins are added, but it's confusing. Showing different page per currency isn't comfortable. There must a single page of all coins available with current prices and even columns with what we hold of them. And then when we touch the respective coin we could see history and price chart while whatever we hold too should be shown at once and total price of what we hold too. There were no such monthly charges when i was using wazirx earlier. This rule has come later.","1. App user interface is not intuitive. 2. While doing KYC if you accidently go back, you will need to refill the info. 3. Also if KYC rejected, whole form needed to be refilled. 4. Not sure where can we see price timeline for coins. It is very important to showcase that at very main screeen. 5. While adding INR money, options provided are only mobikwik even though it shows UPI verified.","Great. Very easy to understand and invest in crypto using this App. Best app out there in market for investing in crypto. Easy to navigate and very easy to understand and you can see prices of crypto updating every second. Much impressed with this app and withdraws and deposits are very easy in this app. The charts for each individual token/coin load very slow and sometimes non responsive with no axes labels. One cannot see the trend over time on the app easily. Wish we had more data and notes.","Really, amazing! This app only has a big name else than that there is nothing about it. About a month ago I placed an order for a shoe. And I received a different product then what i had ordered for, so the very same day I requested for a exchange. Unlike other shopping site Wazirx had quiet a complicated exchange process where in we need to provide all if proof and stuff.

I used to get notifications on my Price alerts and price changes in my watch list fine, with no problems. Now I don't get them anymore. In fact, when I click on the bell in the top right corner, there's a little comment that says \"turn on notifications for this app to start receiving notifications\". But when you click the button to go to your settings, guess what; they're already enabled. Very irritating. S21","I have been facing issues with this app for weeks now, 1. The chart doesn't follow the market price anymore. Sometimes, the market price for a coin with be green in color but the chart for it will be red, and vice versa. 2. This app doesn't follow the rise and fall for coins. At times, a coin might rises with 340% but the app might falls to 98% or 70% or even 100%. 3. And now, as at today, 26th of June 2021, it doesn't even open up. It only throws an error. Kindly fix this error.","I have been using this app for some time now to check prices, trends & read news articles. Then I started experiencing problems. After signing in, I got ab error message and was logged out. Or, not all the info was displaying. Very frustrating. I saw all the negative responses to similar issues and blaming latest update. On 14th I logged a bug problem. On the 16th I received an email from Juvi confirming problem resolved I checked and the app is working perfectly. Thank you for the support.","At first I gave this app five stars. Then I tried to create an account. It took five attempts before they actually sent me a verification email. And then once I tried to verify it asked me if I wanted to use local data or account data. No idea what that means. All I know is that when somebody puts you through this much of a hassle just to create an account it probably isn't worth it, so I'm bucking this down to three stars.

Huge issue with storage size, though. over time, this app will accumulate literally gigabytes of data for no apparent reason. over 3 months, binance grew to 6.5 gigabytes. this absolutely needs to be fixed. In the few days since I reinstalled app, it's already taken up 200mb of storage.","Absolutely the worst experience I've had with a finance app. I created my account and started verification process back in January and they STILL haven't verified my account 6 months later. I even submitted two tickets with - you guessed it - no response whatsoever. It's like they don't even know I exist. GO WITH SOMEONE ELSE. THESE GUYS SUCK ALMOST AS BAD AS ROBINHOOD. Absolute trash, this company is. I wish I could give negative stars.","No option for zero stars. This was a nightmare experience! They locked my account from an issue on their end with their processing server where they could not withdraw my money. They demanded I correct this but my account was locked. Customer support is useless. It took them 1.5 months to finally unlock my deposit function. When I fixed the amount owed, I found I could not trade. It took another month for them to finally unlock trading. I withdrew my money. Don't trust them. Beware.","Unbelievably slow to withdraw funds, even with banking approved and transactions confirmed. Sits in \"Pending.\" Really? My purchases didn't have this issue. 🤔 I'm out, once they finally give me my money. I don't need a ticket opened for stall tactics. I need an app that works as fast taking money OUT as it does putting money IN. This isn't it. I'm missing some outstanding buy opportunities right now because of this app. UPDATE: Finally got my money. Deleting. Too slow to be useful for trades.","I will update this, once they start replying and updating \"email tickets\" appropriately. For no reason, my account was \"blacklisted\" and I am unable to buy or sell. Reached out via their ticketing system, only to have my ticket redirected to another team and have not heard back for over a week on anything being completed.

Used to be good. Then they removed nano, which made sense at the time because of the spam attack. Then it got fixed but nano never returned. You can now ONLY withdraw bitcoin and it's worth like one third the amount you used to get. The \"latest updates\" you see on the google play page is false advertising, front and center. Don't know why they get away with it. Cherry on top - the support team has called it quits.","Used to be good, now insanely low rewards and forces you to pay the BTC miner fees, so you get next to nothing after a ton of work.","Pretty good app, at least it used to be before the pointless (pun intended) update where the points earned no longer go towards Nano currency. Now it's only super inflated Bitcoin where earnings are so low that you couldn't afford even a can of beans after what you would make in a month's time. Not too happy but devs use this comment and take it as a learning experience. Fix your app. You will have my patience and kindness.","Not bad for the type of app it is. Avoid Pollfish surveys as they will lead you through a full length survey then not reward anything. InBrain surveys are hit or miss whether they reward anything at all leading them to be a time sink. Theorem Reach surveys will typically award at least something. The other app related opportunities pretty much don't reward anything. Update: seems all the surveys are now done by Lucid, which requires a lot of unnecessary cookies allowing them to track too much.","3 stars - I've had a lot of fun in the past year with this app, I've made over 50$ btc in my free time playing games, just make sure whichever offer wall you use has a customer support section. When points don't come through you have to email the offer wall for customer service.

The API key was an issue when I first downloaded months ago. Locked me out so I left it alone. Come back today. I try to track down which email/password I started with months ago since it wouldn't let me restart the process with that email and in doing so have locked myself out again. To top it off, I don't remember the API that I will undoubtedly need if I can ever get back in. I'm sure the app is fine but why so many hoops to jump?","The app that make you want to slap yo mama, kidding. I think it's a good start to be in bit there is room for improvement. The biggest things I'd like to see change in the future is not being able to conduct transactions in app, being limited to only wire transfers (and their fees) to fund the account and not listing newer alt coins. The minor change I'd like is the ability to view your investments instead entire market. Apart from the app, their customer service is top notch!","I like the layout and the easily accessible data that is available but freezes up at times forcing you to clear the app from recents and restarting. Has a tendency to just force close on you when you are either making a trade or selling or randomly asking for your password when you decide to make a transaction. Kinda annoying at times. Update: Seems to be fixed as of last update. Problem went away.","This app works GREAT when it WORKS. Can't tell you how much stress the app induced on me alone. The Website Version is ALOT more consistent, thus, would highly recommend sticking to that over the app, UNTIL it improves of course. Update: They have definitely fixed the issue:). App is TEN TIMES BETTER THAN COINBASE AND 100 TIMES BETTER THAN VOYAGER. I love the features and the fact that you can access them both on the app & PC! Must have this downloaded if your an avid crypto fanatic!","Good app. Solid features. It could do a more comprehensive job presenting market data, and it could be more \"information dense\". On an S21u I can only view 5 currencies at a time. And it only sorts alphabetically or by volume. Sorting by price change over various time periods while viewing 3-4 x more currencies at once would be really helpful for keeping track of the market relative to your holdings."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.kraken.trade","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kraken.trade&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Crypto Learn - Study Cryptocurrency & Crypto news","description":"CryptoLearn cryptocurrency mobile application\r\n\r\n\r\nKeeping pace with innovation is the preserve of cryptocurrency market enthusiasts.

No other app is as thorough. However, crypto is impossible to track accurately when u are using DeFi, staking, conversions or simply pay ex fees. So don't have high hopes that you'll be sorted out 100%. My only criticism of the app is some major cap coins are not supported. Check their website to get an idea. If u can afford it, it's worth it. I can't, but fun during trial","Usable to a decent degree. Connected and displays my wallets with easy setup, interface is pretty clean and intuitive. My biggest gripe is my coinbase trades not aligning with the prices cointracker monitors, so every trade is marginally off but eventually adds up. I couldn't confidently DCA with their provided figures since my portfolio simply doesn't reflect my accurate purchases. I chaulk up all this data as \"ballparking\" to dig into my personal/manual tracker to set up some juicy trades.","Free version should a least let you show performance for the current day. Also, the subscription package is too expensive. Update: there is nothing on the top right corner. There are buttons below the chart, and the 1D one, which is almost unselectable because it falls outside the screen, says that I need a subscription to see the data.","Great place to be able to view my entire portfolio from multiple exchanges/wallets. Better as a big picture thing, as it doesn't keep super accurate prices up to the minute. Looks like it'll awesome for taxes. It tracks every transaction from all of my accounts.","The app is pretty good. Only thing I don't like is how long it takes to refresh your portfolio... I could make a transaction and I won't see it in the app until 30 mins later. Even if you keep refreshing it. But other than that, pretty good"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"io.cointracker.android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.cointracker.android&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"ANYCOIN - Universal Cryptocurrency Converter","description":"Anycoin is the most powerful and easy-to-use currency and cryptocurrency live exchange rate converter.

Though if you have any sort of problem then it doesn't get addressed. Customer support is very poor and only reachable by email. It takes ages to get a response and most of the time it will not be a helpful one. Since this app deals with money it takes a huge hit because of customer care as there can't be any trust if you don't get clarification or resolution for your problems.","Good for nothing. Very very slow.. Very less users which means you end up in loss either buying or selling as there are few takers. They just hoard your funds. Can't withdraw. The process to contact customer care is a serious pain. Using this app is just a punishment for crypto lovers. Worst part is order placing. If you use your 100% funds to buy or sell. It tells you insufficient funds and by the time you redo. The price is gone and again loss. So in simple words. Loss loss loss and harrasment","App is gud but having some issue in open orders my open orders are still showing pending after 2 days which is not good as compare to other apps. Add another window in which we can directly purchased coins instead of waiting more on open orders. Coindcx is having separate window for dis. If u fix dis issue I will give 5 star","Worst aap ever, every time there was a problem with authenticator code or disable 2fa, it's has been 8 days my account is not responding, and after i book a ticket there is no response from support team. You have to improve you response and fix a bug lot of people are suffering","Every thing you done is great in this application. But there is some issues like lagging, not responding, and yes, make it remember my trading tool's like rsi, macd, all lines. Every time I have to redone everything and it's so frustrating. I am looking forward with this application. All though great great job with all the features. Keep it up and we will keep supporting team bit.

Had deposited INR but it hasn't reflected in my coindcx account yet. Raised request tickets, dropped mails, sent bank statements - no response. And I've been patient, this happened on the 29th of May. I'm not even sure what the situation is as there is no response. Ticket number: 499777 Issue still not resolved. It's been over a month.","Don't use this misleading app, Even after raising multiple tickets #529893, #527566, #541230 and #526988, I didn't recieve my money back they are misleading the customers and stealing money from them. The worst app ever, would give zero starts if there was an option. Edit-still didn't receive my money worst service ever.","In terms of interface the app is fantastic. This app can be a good starter for the beginners who are entering into the crypto market. Also, they are not charging any transaction fee as of now apart from mobiqwick. The major drawback that i faced is regarding the inr deposit. It took around 5 days to get reflected in my wallet. And right now they have removed the option as well. If the payment issue is resolved by providing instant option i personelly don't hesistate to give 5 stars.","There are alot of problems with this app: 1. Deposits are only possible with Mobiquick app and they usually charge 1.5% fee + 0.1% fee on every trade. 2. Deposits are not available or show some error 30% of the time and are not there when price of crypto drops 3. Support system is horrible and don't expect to get your problem fixed with a request. 4. Currencies like Dogecoin and Polkadot CANNOT be withdrawn and used so you don't even own some of the currencies.","The app has proven to be a failure when it comes to incorporating different payment methods. Suddenly they have taken away the UPI option. I wanted to buy the dip but couldn't do so.

Introduced to the world in the form of Bitcoin in 2009, blockchain technology uses digital ledger to produce and store immutable records of anything that happens over blockchain.\r\n\r\nAbout Bitbns\r\n\r\nBitbns is a part of Buyhatke Internet Pvt. Ltd. - the parent organisation, which was incorporated in 2015. With 70+ cryptocurrencies listed at present, Bitbns allows users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies at best available prices and offers ease of trading like no other cryptocurrency exchange. Some of the top cryptocurrencies one can trade on Bitbns are Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Litecoin (LTC), Binance Coin (BNB), Neo (NEO) and more.\r\n\r\nOne of the notable recent updates to Bitbns has been the introduction of the USDT market, where users can trade cryptocurrencies against USDT. \r\n\r\nMargin Leverage\r\nOnly Bitbns brings you the ability to trade 4 times your net worth with 4X Margin Leverage. To trade with 4X leverage, a user can borrow 3 times their net worth and trade with a total of 4X leverage on Bitbns. The minimum net worth a user needs to have on Bitbns is Rs. 2,000. Bitbns recommends its users to couple margin trading with bracket order to avoid volatility risks.\r\n\r\nMargin Lending\r\nLend your funds with Margin Lending, which is a feature you can find in the margin trading section.

Though if you have any sort of problem then it doesn't get addressed. Customer support is very poor and only reachable by email. It takes ages to get a response and most of the time it will not be a helpful one. Since this app deals with money it takes a huge hit because of customer care as there can't be any trust if you don't get clarification or resolution for your problems.","Good for nothing. Very very slow.. Very less users which means you end up in loss either buying or selling as there are few takers. They just hoard your funds. Can't withdraw. The process to contact customer care is a serious pain. Using this app is just a punishment for crypto lovers. Worst part is order placing. If you use your 100% funds to buy or sell. It tells you insufficient funds and by the time you redo. The price is gone and again loss. So in simple words. Loss loss loss and harrasment","App is gud but having some issue in open orders my open orders are still showing pending after 2 days which is not good as compare to other apps. Add another window in which we can directly purchased coins instead of waiting more on open orders. Coindcx is having separate window for dis. If u fix dis issue I will give 5 star","Worst aap ever, every time there was a problem with authenticator code or disable 2fa, it's has been 8 days my account is not responding, and after i book a ticket there is no response from support team. You have to improve you response and fix a bug lot of people are suffering","Every thing you done is great in this application. But there is some issues like lagging, not responding, and yes, make it remember my trading tool's like rsi, macd, all lines. Every time I have to redone everything and it's so frustrating.

It shows profit based on peak price reached when the actual profit would be according to the profit targets give by your own app. This is misleading people, atleast a range of min and max profit should be shown. Edit: Developer says this will be added in next updates so I increased my rating!","Hi, Edited my review because all the previous issues are solved, also upping to 4 star :) The remaining issues though: - most times I have to click on a signal 4-5 times when the targets open down, somehow the UI is glitchy - the other huge issue as I see it is the need of using 1.1.1.1 app otherwise the prices and notifications don't update, thats very bad because with that App on, Binance doesnt work correctly for example, also other apps dont like it, it makes for a bad experience overall.","Terrible app. 15 out of 15 trades lost. Better odds just picking a coin because you like the name, then flipping a coin to decide on long or short. To make things even better for any potential users it says 3 days free trial. I cancelled on the 3rd day 6am and said it will cancel end of day. Meaning you will get charged for the month you dnt want","The best app for signals. Every internet app has delayed push notifications, so not a unique problem. Besides you still have plenty of time to join most trades(except scalp). Nice personal touch too, with the constant 'only go in 10%', 'take profit' warnings haha","Great job on the recent updates . The app is alot smoother now . Don't listen to the bad reviews that are looking for spoon fed trades and complaining when no trades are posted . This guy goes out of his way to warn people about market volatility and when to stay in cash . He waits for the market instead of chasing it. Apparently this is something a lot of the people commenting here still need to learn. Don't let the bad reviews from the clueless drones discourage you.

The app is clean & functional. However, for over a month now they have blocked me from withdrawing dogecoin due to \"technical issues\" that they are unwilling to elaborate on. Everyone's suspicion is that they are insolvent, or, at the very least, manipulating the market. And to make matters worse, tickets go unanswered and when you question them about it on Telegram and Reddit, they block you.","Don't ever go with this exchange. I'm unable to login with 2FA as I changed my phone. Even after providing all the information over the mail thread started with the ticket, I'm not getting any response. I fear I would ever get singed into my account. Ticket#787115 Update: when I posted this, their team immediately replied this review pretending they care about their customers. But still no response to the ticket and my all money is lost. This is a real scam.","Worst experience using this app, they charge you ridiculous fees for withdrawal and the platform itself is stupid as it has no wallet so you need to have another wallet if you wish to take your own money out (whatevers left of it after theyve taken their massive cut) and yes they will claim they charge this fees for a safe transaction but others also have safe transactions but you dont see them overcharging!! Please do not use this!!","Worst crypto app. Trying for a month and half to restore my 2-FA due to device loss and still no answer from support. Provided everything they asked for: ID, contract hash numbers, and verification selfie. Not a word since. Strongly suggest to keep your funds away. Ticket is 760248- please release my account.","Horrible app extremely high fees even though it's flat but still it's higher than any app I've used. Withdrawal is a nightmare.

Like others here have mentioned. I tried moving my dogecoin to another wallet and the transaction is stuck on pending. It's almost a month now and there's no response to emails because there's no other option to reach them.","Hello , people dont get this wallet it is just waste of money . I tried it at 2020 and it was all good at that time but now it is getting worse. They take 10 doge as a fee for transfer . Well as u can see 1 doge on other platforms. So as my experience this the worst app ever i have used . Its so worst that when i tried to transfer my dogecoin from cryptonator at the time when the fee was 1 doge it never happened. They failed my transfer every time and now they have just increase the doge fee.","Was working great at first but once dogecoin shot up it started having serious issues, it's been down for a month and tons of us are still waiting on a reply from you guys, your support isn't doing any supporting at all cause no one has gotten any answers, we're all left in the blind here, sooner or later you guys will have to answer for what you're doing.","Dogecoin went \"offline\" for two weeks, meaning you were unable to access your crypto, so no sending or trading. Completely ridiculous. 100% Scam Service. The value of the coin cut in half in that time. Cryptonator is NOT regulated and charges exorbitant fees. Use Binance or Coinbase instead.","I transferred my 23000 dogecoin in my another wallet in 19th May, but in my cryptonator transaction activity still showing my transaction in pending why? If system is pending from your side so please revert back my transaction. Last so many days I continues sent you reminder on your given mail id, but from your side no any response for me. Really your system and your support team not working properly. Totally time and money waste.

Email reset won't send. App is up to date. No response other than an automated email saying there was a problem and to update. Concerned my account was compromised and whomever is having all the time in the world to steal my money and identity. AT BEST Voyager has stolen $100 plus dollars from me. DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE Once again I have to file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau.","Super easy to use. Nice to be able to fund asap unlike a lot of other exchanges or custodians. Entry to the crypto space is great. Following areas of improvement: the \"Slide/Swipe\" to buy is a bit weird as I'd prefer something like a button with less motion. The app could be made more snappier. Scrolling left/right to holdings performance is a bit weird. But aside from all that, I'm a fan of the product and business model. THE INTEREST IS JUST AWESOME 😎.","Be ready to pay a premium. You will always buy at the ask price and sell at the bid price. The difference on the app is 2-5%. So potentially u will lose 5% when you buy and when you sell. Most good exchanges the difference is way less than .05%... Here you are in the hole 10% by the time you cash out. Crypto withdrawal fees are highest in business as well.. over $40 for some tokens, compared to $2-4 for others. That said the app is very easy to use and UI is great. Worth it?- you decide","#SHIBARMY ALL THE WAY! Thanks for listing! Update: After posting my review I read others and I am confused with the latest comments. I've used Voyager for about a month and a half and it has been nothing but a great app. I have never experienced any lag on transferring fiat to and from the app. Never any issues with buying or converting crypto; no issues what so ever. Don't know what they mean, Voyager is one of the easiest apps to invest in crypto.","Started off okay. Not sure about the fees but my issue is that I can't log in or change my password due to \"internal server issues\". This has been going on for weeks now.

The newly designed screens better explain when you will get rewarded and for how much. We’ve also improved support ticket submissions so that we can resolve issues around shopping rewards faster.","comments":["Love the idea & the app, but it has a few drawbacks that make it difficult to use consistently. 1st, I don't always remember to log in through stormx to do my checking out, so I've missed out on hundreds of dollars of purchases this month. 2nd, if the app was easy to shop in, I wouldn't have to worry about the issue #1. The app is atrocious for shopping/browsing stores through the app. Can't get logged into some stores, can't navigate on others. Back button will have you starting over, etc.","It's a good concept, but the past few times I've played games to get rewards, the reward disappears before I'm able to complete it. It'll say in the rules \"within 20 days of installing\" and I'll go check on the status within 7, and the reward info isn't even available. This has happened to me twice. It doesn't even store it in my history. I'm frustrated.","Ordered some things on Aliexpress. At first, I thought it didn't work, but in a week or so the points showed up for my purchases. Good app, good concept. Can be improved, of course but going in the right direction.","Pretty cool to earn crypto rewards for shopping and playing games on ur phone! When I had an issue receiving a reward, customer service was responsive and resolved the issue quickly. Excites for the debit card launch!!!","So far it works for me as advertised, I find the browser extension easier to shop with but the phone app is nice for quick things. I have completed a few games where they didn't send reward, but submitting a screenshot to them always led to full payout for me."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.cakecodes.bitmaker","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cakecodes.bitmaker&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Vertfolio - Cryptocurrency Portfolio Tracker","description":"Vertfolio is an all-in-one cryptocurrency manager and a cryptocurrency portfolio tracker app.\r\n\r\nIt helps you to track all kinds of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and 300 more altcoins with real-time price updates.

Price from main window do not align with hourly charts. Never know what is giving the correct information. Import/export portfolios not working. It would be great if it were possible to have multiple portfolios.","Very nice but it takes a bit long to refresh/ update the balance of tracked addresses  Edit: answering your questione in my case it  is the bitcoin wallet address that is slow to update but  it is not a big deal. Also prices (rates) take some time to update. I usually use the synch holdings feature and everything gets updated eventually. My connection seems  fine and other apps work faster but yours is very good, thanks","Has everything I need, but the GUI needs some tweaking. Some settings are hard to find. Takes a while to learn how to use it properly. I like that I can define the amount of money I have invested and it compares the worth of the portfolio to that value.","love it, It does the job of three of my old apps, so I was able to free up more space on my phone and now I dont have to bounce between apps to see my portfolio, check prices on altcoins, read current news, I just wish we could get an exchange and everything this app has all in one, now that would be a good setup.","The best portfolio app I've come across. Other apps are super flowery and pretty and take forever to load up and do anything on my phone. The person who made this understands that it's more important that the app be useful than keep up with the latest greatest and prettiest design trends that buckle any non-like 8 core beast machine smartphone. I would give it 5 stars if the address tracking let you enter addresses via QR codes. If you have a lot of accounts, it can take forever to copy the addresses by cut and paste. Especially on wallet apps that make you enter a code or do 2FA every time you switch away from them. If I could just pull up my accounts on wallet's web interface and just scan qr codes in seconds, that'd be a lot easier. Other apps let you do this, but their list of accepted tokens is a total and complete joke compared to this one. Like literally some except 8 tokens and not even like the top 8 by market cap. Just a joke. If this takes QR codes, it's killing every other app."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"bitsnapp.com.bitsnapp","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bitsnapp.com.bitsnapp&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"CryptoTrax - Bitcoin & Cryptocurrency Portfolio","description":"CryptoTrax is a simple Bitcoin & cryptocurrency portfolio app and market tracker that totals your crypto holdings against live prices.\r\n\r\nYou have the choice of 250 altcoins to add your current holdings.

You have no business having this app on the market when your poor product puts someone at financial risk.","Right I am giving this four stars for now because its quite easy to use, there are some issues though, at times can be sluggish, this includes as other critics have mentioned the price alerts being slow and would be nice to be able to purchase other currencies, like doge Shiba and so on, also some news on the card would be nice, other than that it's not a bad app or platform."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.coinjar.riemann","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coinjar.riemann&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Coinverse - cryptocurrency news, bitcoin, ethereum","description":"Not on Android? - Subscribe for expansion updates @ bit.ly/coinverse-beta1. \r\nAre you a developer? - Check out the open source code @ bit.ly/coinverse-open-app. \r\n\r\nDiscover Cryptocurrency News🚀\r\nCoinverse (beta) is the first cryptocurrency news app for audiocasts while offering video and text about Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dash, and more.

Leave a review if you’re enjoying the improvements.","comments":["My experience has been so good, i felt i needed to write a review for others who need a good wallet and cant decide based on others feedback. The app is so user friendly. Is very easy on the eyes. Is super quick. Ive downloaded close to 15 other wallet apps and with BRD i transferred in some BCH (bitcoin cash) the transfers were lightening speed. Literally in split seconds. And network fees $0.00. Wallet fees? $0.00. Yes it cost me absolutely nothing to send BCH in split seconds. I love it 5/5.","Pretty good app for the most part but sometimes you will get an error message when trying to trade between cryptos and it only give a error code and does not tell you what went wrong. Most of the ti.e it is because the app doesn't want you to transfer all of your coin to another coin. For ie. If I have $500 in BTC and want to put that all into ETH I will get an error code. Now if I leave $20 in my BTC and transfer the rest it works pretty good. Buy BRD coin you will save money in trading coin.","Horrible app for your crypto wallet. As soon as my last few transactions clear I am uninstalling. I have been using this app for over a year now and it has literally got worse over time. Transactions take forever for no reason. Overcharge for everything. Trust me...find another wallet. You'll thank me later","Its on the right track, and I like access to the smaller coins, the fees are pretty high if you are trying to purchase and move things quickly, but if you are a patient person and plan ahead, you can work around a good chunk of the fees.","WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS WALLET TO ANYONE!!!Biggest rip off. They change thier price for you to transfer bitcoin all the time. No joke when i firet downloaded it cost me cents to a couple dollars to transfer.

Adding tap and hold functionality for interacting with objects would greatly improve it. Edit: I'm moving this to 1 star. The bugs never get fixed, no notable improvements or features, clearly badly tested and is just an advertising cash cow. I'll give it a bit more time before removing it as it has some promising features, but with the constant frustration, it has become tiresome to use. Last chance before I delete","Love the lay out. Exactly what I was looking for. But unfortunately, the android version is buggy. Paid version findings. 1) crashes pretty consistently, esp. when navigating portfolios. 2) holding view option, often freezes, or crashes. Just doesn't appear, have to exit, hard close, reenter. 3) coins listed on app, but can not add to portfolio. Manual entry still has a price pop up, but some coins it does not. Update: prices are about 10 minutes delayed. Kinda useless.","I'm super impressed with this app, they have very good accurate charts for low cap coins, as well as the popular ones.

Only some of the currencies have their own logo, the rest shows a purple dot.","App has too many bugs and the bot is not smart at all. I tested for 2 months and I basically didn't make a penny. If you want to use a bot Kucoin is your much better. Let me better explain: 1) Not able to see portfolio value because of a recurring that happens at least once in a week. 2) Portfolio value vs Binance value is not imdentical 3) Your bot does not have strategy for bear market. Yes you win in a bull market as you win on any other bot, nothing special about this.","Without going into too much detail, it is a good app. The foundation is in place, it is working and making profits, but on the other hand the experience is so raw and frustraiting.

Where are these extra doge going? Are they going somewhere or are users simply forced to overpay? No option to edit fee. Strangely, it seems honest and correct for other coins.

Mainly, a refresh button would go a long way. Otherwise, you have to close the app and reopen. Also, if you have more than one portfolio, it would be nice to choose which one it default opens to. Right now it defaults to the first portfolio entered.","Really nice app with a lot of potential. Trying to make it my go to app for everything crypto but its not quite ready yet. For instance, prices are rarely correct and prices almost always vary greatly from the regular page to favorites. Seems its just a refresh problem. Secondly, on the charts. Very nice with the candlesticks. One quirk though as its right justified and would be super if the current day bar was to the left just a bit as its hard to see as the bar is all the way to the right","The app looks nice in screenshots, but I see no value in it after thoroughly testing it a number of times. 1) Buy BTC with GBP, then sell BTC for ETH but ETH does not show up in your portfolio? 2) Very confusing interface when entering transactions. 3) Alerts make regular notification sound therefore go unnoticed until you look at your phone. 4) Still not working on tablet. When you tap add transaction you get a white screen. Frustrating at best. The search for a tracking app goes on.","Love the app and follower of Dan on Crypto Capitol Venture. Just one critique though...the decimal point needs to be reconfigured to now account for coins like SHIB and the other joke coins. It says I'm 100% red in the P/L but the decimal point only goes to .0001. We need the Dev team to change that and be able to accommodate say like 0.00000001 decimal places. Other than that keep up the great work over there and May you portfolio always be green!!","Glad to see EURO on there. Would be good to have more decimal points in BTC transactions added to the portfolio. It now rounds up too soon."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"io.blockgains.mobile","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.blockgains.mobile&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"AMBANK Coin - Cryptocurrency Faster, High Security","description":"AMBK is the next evolution of electronic money, fast, efficient, secure, and highly private. \r\n\r\nThe first mixed cryptocurrency designed for investors,\r\n  merchants, and affiliates.\r\n\r\nAMBK Coin uses the first anonymous, proof of ownership protocol (Proof of Stake), called zPoS, and offers a global, open source payment network that is fully decentralized, with the generation of zAMBK deterministic algorithm, for easy backups and additional security.\r\n\r\nAMBK Coin, is an Internet peer-to-peer (P2P) currency, which allows private, instant, and fast transactions using the Zerocoin protocol, with low transaction fees to anyone in the world.\r\n\r\nThe modern technology, implemented in the AMBK Coin, has created significant advantages over Bitcoin, and other newer cryptocurrencies.

If start a transfer and change to another app to copy the address and return I need to start again because the state is not saved. Also I tried to transfer the tokens to another wallet (Trust Wallet) and the app crashes. When I try to scan another safemoon address to send it recognizes the qrcode and decodes it but it desapears almost instantly. Also the loading when changing screen is annoying.","This is a very efficient platform with a big future. I have been very pleased with the rate at which improvements are made to any bugs. I can send and receive my tokens at a fast pace, as well as a strong sense of security. The layout of the wallet is designed expertly in the sense that it's simple to digest and maneuver. The vision that the team with SparkPoint has for the project is exciting beyond words right now. I am very excited for future announcements and added utility with this project.","App is very clean and easy to use, similar to other wallets. Works very fast and smooth. Everytime you change screen, you need to log in again (like in the bank apps) which I feel much more comfortable for security reasons. Overall very satisfied with the interface and looking forward for the following developments!","So far I can confirm that I didn't have any big issues with SparkPoint Wallet and I hope they will keep the higher safety and security standards in future and we will not be lost or stolen our cryptocurrencies. For me SparkPoint wallet is one of the best choses to keep your cryptocurrencies in safe and secure way... So, I recommend it. I love this project as a whole, and I believe huge things are coming through this Wallet!","Great App Designs, Great User Interface, and with the least Hussle. Covered both BEP-20 TOKENS and ERC-20 TOKENS so I can say it supports most of the Tokens you can find in the exchange. From the wallet itself you're able to connect to the whole SPARK ecosystem which is very great."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.sparkpoint","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sparkpoint&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Crypto Coin Market : Cryptocurrency Simulator","description":"You buy and sell coin in the app .
