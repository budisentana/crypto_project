I gave it 4 stars because it is not completely perfect to use and navigate, transaction history does not reflect all the transactions made by me whether it is sending or receiving coins and I wish the notifications of this app is working or is it just me because I am using an older version of android 8. I hope you can fix this and overall it is a good app not great.","This has got to be the worst crypto wallet I've ever used. Tons of bugs and glitches, complicated staking procedures, and the fees are very high. On top of that I lost coins due to a problem with the wallet and customer service is simply incapable of understanding my problem or helping. My advice would be to stay away from this app.","Works well for me and I do recommend. Sometimes it takes a little time for transactions to go through but this is true for most transactions of this type. One thing to makes sure is you keep enough etherum to pay for the transaction if that is what is used for the fees. So just don't zero it out is what I am saying.","Great app for a beginner, such as myself. More up and coming coins need to be added. The ability to sell and trade coins directly thru the wallet would make it the best on the market. And if you really want to solidify #1 spot, bring the community of AWC users together like they've done on my favorite trading platform.","Great app, easy to use. So many nice features. Could use some added features. It's hard to know what your total returns on investments is since it doesn't keep track of where you stared. Haven't had great success in identifying if I've made anything on my staking crypto either.

Major problem is the lag which often ends in crashes. Everytime it does that, all the scores and GWEI went with it, leaving you back on level 1. Crashes are very common when you're doing great with your game. It's like it does not favor that you win and make great points. As to the ETH you can earn, it's too minute and almost neglible to even think playing this game for years can change your life in the long run.","Amazing game ! I find myself sitting down for a quick 5-10 game and an hour later I'm still playing. It really does pay out, instantly ! EDIT : 07-25-21 The game used to be 5 stars, now it's a weak 3 star game. Adds have increased 100%. I just scored 32000+ and for that effort, I was given 675 gwei ?!! A score like that should have paid out 4x that amount. Come on team, don't get cheap on us, the price of Ethereum is down. The payout SHOULD GO UP !!!!!!","Does what it says it does. Great mindless game for meetings or when watching TV. If you're going to mess around on Candy Crush, why not get paid for it? I've made some decent cash off of this and it's funding my smaller crypto investments. Yeah, there's ads. You get used to them, especially once you know how long they last. Just put the tv on and look up when an ad comes on. Great app, wish there were more like it.","Pays out easily and quickly with coinbase. 5 stars. The game is fun. BUT!!! constantly glitches and you have to start over. I was just on a roll, my best game. Start of level 6, a flash, and im back at level 1, and my coins are gone! You still get credit for ETH. But its totally deflating, and makes people stop playing. IF THE GAME STOPPED CRASHING ID GIVE 5 STARS AND PLAY MORE. VERY DISAPPOINTED","Sure enough, it pays out Ethereum almost instantly. It's kind of hard to get figured out, though. You need to go into where it says redeem in order to get it sent to your wallet. Doesn't add up fast at all, but it's an all right time waster.

Best crypto widgets (come with the app). The only feature I wish for would be a year long chart widget. I know this sounds unnecessary because yesterday's year-long chart will be similar to today's and tomorrow's, and because many people have a mental image of the last year. However, for myself, it's easy to forget exactly when things happened 8 or 9 months ago, & that's important for seasonal trends. I can look it up, & just remember, but I end up w/ a static image in mind.","An amazing app for both news and keeping up with crypto prices. The choice of alarm settings are great and the widgets that come along with the app are useful too. Highly advise buying the pro version. You get what you pay for with it.","I mainly use the app for the widgets on my homescreen, to get a quick look. This used to work like a charm. Now the widgets don't update anymore for like a week already. Fix this and you'll get 5 stars.","The (less than<) function for the alarms I set stopped working. Only notified for the (greater than >) ones. Emailed company twice with no response or fix. I see another person had this issue also. Was working fine until a month ago.","Advised that the wallet will cease to exist soon, recommended to move my funds. I can't withdraw the funds using the same card that I bought the Bitcoin with because it's a Visa, but I also cannot transfer the currency because my total doesn't meet the minimum transfer amount. I feel like I've been scammed so that I can't access my currency.

I think they need to make it more clear that those arrows on the side are the send and receive buttons. I think they should also display your balance first before they show the price of the cryptocurrency. What I mean is that instead of having to switch to see your balance I think you should have to switch to see the price of what ever cryptocurrency you are on. Other than those two things the app is amazing! 😄👏🏼","This wallet is all we need. More and more coins are added and the best part is that this wallet is user friendly. I highly suggest to use their desktop wallet for best experience. Their support is also superb. I can still remember when I had some issues with my deposits way back in 2017, they were helpful and very professional. Keep it up exodus, cheers!","Slider shows wrong value when you are at 6 months scope - how can be peak of a price graph be 30 while the dip is 50? I do remember when I bought but it is about money it really shouldn't show wrong values. Nice design. I would like to see auto note about price when I did recive or send. And my average - just a lil bit of analytics. ( any price graph has this bug - it is more apparent with scope 1+ month)","The app is indeed very convenient; its design is well suited for everyday crypto needs, however the problem on my phone (which is running Android 8.1) is that the app requires more CPU and RAM resources than the phone is okay dealing with, which results in a significant delay when loading the UI screen for each requested functionality; in short - it's slow. Other than that it's a great tool to have. For legit advice on acquiring Bitcoin with zero investment see cb.run/earn-bitcoin-free","Exodus is by far the best wallet when it comes to UI/UX.

Heartily Recommend.","Overall. Great! Only 2 small issues since having the app and now on my desktop. I couldn't do 5 ⭐ because the app and desktop are usually never synced together. The app shows one amount and PC a totally different amount even if I was to sync them at the exact time. That's probably my biggest issue. Other than that an awesome and secured wallet. Oh and it would be nice for the tokens to be updated and not have to manually put them in. That's all...","The pin security doesn't work! I lock my screen, unlock and the app is still open. What's the point in even having a pin set if you don't all for it?","I tried 20+ wallet and this is the best one. Caters both to advanced users and beginners alike, well organized and nice to look at. Most wallet software feels like either a hobby project or designed in a dungeon.

The newly designed screens better explain when you will get rewarded and for how much. We’ve also improved support ticket submissions so that we can resolve issues around shopping rewards faster.","comments":["Love the idea & the app, but it has a few drawbacks that make it difficult to use consistently. 1st, I don't always remember to log in through stormx to do my checking out, so I've missed out on hundreds of dollars of purchases this month. 2nd, if the app was easy to shop in, I wouldn't have to worry about the issue #1. The app is atrocious for shopping/browsing stores through the app. Can't get logged into some stores, can't navigate on others. Back button will have you starting over, etc.","It's a good concept, but the past few times I've played games to get rewards, the reward disappears before I'm able to complete it. It'll say in the rules \"within 20 days of installing\" and I'll go check on the status within 7, and the reward info isn't even available. This has happened to me twice. It doesn't even store it in my history. I'm frustrated.","Ordered some things on Aliexpress. At first, I thought it didn't work, but in a week or so the points showed up for my purchases. Good app, good concept. Can be improved, of course but going in the right direction.","Pretty cool to earn crypto rewards for shopping and playing games on ur phone! When I had an issue receiving a reward, customer service was responsive and resolved the issue quickly. Excites for the debit card launch!!!","So far it works for me as advertised, I find the browser extension easier to shop with but the phone app is nice for quick things. I have completed a few games where they didn't send reward, but submitting a screenshot to them always led to full payout for me."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.cakecodes.bitmaker","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cakecodes.bitmaker&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"TabTrader Buy Bitcoin and Ethereum on exchanges","description":"TabTrader is a FREE all-in-one trading terminal for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoins on various cryptocurrency exchanges such as Binance, BitBay, BitBNS, Bitfinex, BitMEX, Bitstamp, Bittrex, BL3P, Bleutrade, Bybit, Cex.io, Coincheck, CoinDCX, CoinFLEX, Coinsbit, Currency.com, Coinbase Pro, Deribit, Exmo, FTX, Gemini, HitBTC, HUOBI, Indodax, ItBit, Kraken, Kucoin, Lykke, Mercado Bitcoin, Okex, Poloniex, TheRock, Timex, Whitebit. \r\n\r\nTrade crypto, monitor your portfolio, perform technical analysis, get instantly notified about changes on the market. \r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n• Fast advanced price charts including Heikin Ashi \r\n• Easy-to-navigate interface \r\n• API exchange accounts of all major cryptocurrency exchanges\r\n• Spot trading.

Maybe they are just 'busy' but it's been two weeks since I submitted my ticket and I still haven't conversed with a human! Ergo, one star because the app installs. Nothing more as my BTC are still yet to be found since I 'smart' transferred them in. I would avoid this app at the present time based solely on the support experience. [edit] Support ticket#333616 has been responded to - thank you - +1 more star. [edit#2] - you mention refund but the ticket says the partner has all the info and to create a new PAYIN BTC. All very confusing. We will see. [edit#3]. They eventually refunded me, however based on this experience I still cannot recommend nor give > 2 stars - especially when they ask me to edit the review. If I had enough funds I would transfer what little BTC I have elsewhere and close the account.","For the most part I like the app alot. I transferred in out and exchanged numerous times with no problems. It's always worked smoothly before.....I sent 14.9 xrp \"with the correct tag number included\" ......and never recieved the xrp. I submitted a ticket. Waited. Then got an email saying they are backed up on tickets and are trashing all existing open tickets and to submit a new one. I did. It's been a week since I submitted the new one. Costumer Service at freewallet is a joke.","ticket ID is 315537 Update: The customer service officially provided me the things i needed to submit. And i sent their requirements, hopefully i got to access my account, finally. *Ratings may change depends on their response. Update: They fix my problem.

And why? I've never seen another app exchange ever have these issues. The date and time that was requested for payout or exchange should be honored. It was offered to the users as functional, and hasn't been the case on your end as promised.. These excuses are not acceptable. Compensation seems appropriate for start.","Apparently, the WORST app ever. Been trying to sign up since forever. I've re-installed the app severally.

Its interface is easy to use. Great for beginners. I hope they add more coins in the future. Watch out when using the exchange. They won't return your tokens after cancellation. Beware.","Simple, clean, and source available. Beware, though. They claim only the minimum blockchain fees are assessed but the build distributed here charges multiple doge, sometimes tens or even hundreds, when Dogecoin famously only requires 1 doge for even large transactions. Where are these extra doge going? Are they going somewhere or are users simply forced to overpay? No option to edit fee. Strangely, it seems honest and correct for other coins. I use the langerhans wallet for Dogecoin anyway but it's frustrating because I'd like to recommend this one for general multi-coin use.","Says it converts DOGE, then doesn't let you. Transferred crypto over to it and now wasted a fee to do that and going to get charged for going somewhere else. This is a waste of your time, find another app, another site, anywhere that you can that will let you convert what you want to. Seems pretty dodgy to advertise something and then not do anything that you've said. The app is easy enough to use, and that's the only reason for not giving a 1, simple and basic, nothing to say there, but definitely not worth your time for trading.","Great app just having trouble getting a old account back as I don't know of the log in","Charged me a $10 fee for buying $30 of Bitcoin, then only alaws me to send half of what I put in.

Leave a review if you’re enjoying the improvements.","comments":["My experience has been so good, i felt i needed to write a review for others who need a good wallet and cant decide based on others feedback. The app is so user friendly. Is very easy on the eyes. Is super quick. Ive downloaded close to 15 other wallet apps and with BRD i transferred in some BCH (bitcoin cash) the transfers were lightening speed. Literally in split seconds. And network fees $0.00. Wallet fees? $0.00. Yes it cost me absolutely nothing to send BCH in split seconds. I love it 5/5.","Pretty good app for the most part but sometimes you will get an error message when trying to trade between cryptos and it only give a error code and does not tell you what went wrong. Most of the ti.e it is because the app doesn't want you to transfer all of your coin to another coin. For ie. If I have $500 in BTC and want to put that all into ETH I will get an error code. Now if I leave $20 in my BTC and transfer the rest it works pretty good. Buy BRD coin you will save money in trading coin.","Horrible app for your crypto wallet. As soon as my last few transactions clear I am uninstalling. I have been using this app for over a year now and it has literally got worse over time. Transactions take forever for no reason. Overcharge for everything. Trust me...find another wallet. You'll thank me later","Its on the right track, and I like access to the smaller coins, the fees are pretty high if you are trying to purchase and move things quickly, but if you are a patient person and plan ahead, you can work around a good chunk of the fees.","WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS WALLET TO ANYONE!!!Biggest rip off. They change thier price for you to transfer bitcoin all the time. No joke when i firet downloaded it cost me cents to a couple dollars to transfer. I just transfered 105 dollars and i didnt even look and they charged me $33. Complete rip off. I dont know how they sleep at night!

I also wish I had the option to mine all 3 options at once even if this where an upgrade only feature. The name multi-mine lead me to believe I would have this ability, which is what drew me to the app originally. Def recommend!","So far I like the app. I upgraded to gold and it moves much faster!The speed is fine. Few things to read. You have to get verified and it can take up to 10 days however it stated you can request to send it through the platform to speed it up. Within that timline you'd have to wait to cash out which can take up to 5 business days. I read how to avoid losing Satoshi bc it is how the user manipulate the app opposite of what the developers recommendation bc support helped me with the issue.","Great mining App, I've mined before, weeks on end, month after month, after 90 days I couldn't even visit the dollar store. This app is legit, you spend 20 1ce and easily make 80, I always forget about my phone and app stuff. I like doing real things, hardly turning it on I make a 400% profit. Il invest the total $120 next time I bet It would make new car payments for me","Lost BCH, around 17,000. Will update if fixed. Update, still not fixed and now missing even more from the btc tab. Will update if fixed. Email many times, messaged from the dashboard on website and put in multiple requests for missing Satoshi and not fixed. They keep taking the Satoshi that their customers accumulate on their app. You build up 10,000 plus sat on any or multiple tabs on the app one day it's gone. And they do not respond except to send you an email to update your wallet info. Scam","So. It's nice seeing numbers run at the toppa ya screen, but I been waiting for my “pending” request to be completed for about 14 days now. It's getting annoying. Also, if you think you can mine, while your phone is on standby, and by that I don't even mean closing the app, but just pushing the power button so the screen turns dark (but the phone's still on), you are terribly wrong!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.task.multimine","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.task.multimine&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"EtherScan- ETH Blockchain Explorer","description":"This App the first mobile blockchain browser in the ethereum community.

The fact that Argent makes any attempt at all to layer and save gas is remarkable, because a wallet's job is purely to store and address, issue transactions and the rest is UI.

Just wish it was updated more often (i.e. Sets was deprecated, but you wouldn't have known because Argent took a while to remove those tokens 😢)","My favorite wallet hands down!

Why the chat option is initiated when the person want to sell,just wastage of time, Should be fast,your prosses is very slow and disappouting.","Edit: got scammed (didn't follow guides- lesson learned). The app lets you pay someone, then cancel the trade without seller confirming they've refunded :\\ Used in-app reporting, but nothing happened. Later learned you have to raise a support ticket to quickly sort disputes. However, support was great once they were on it, and won the dispute pretty quickly. There's a slightly frustrating learning curve, and UI can be a bit clunky, but once you find how to get help they're good.

Like others here have mentioned. I tried moving my dogecoin to another wallet and the transaction is stuck on pending.

I tried it at 2020 and it was all good at that time but now it is getting worse. They take 10 doge as a fee for transfer . Well as u can see 1 doge on other platforms. So as my experience this the worst app ever i have used . Its so worst that when i tried to transfer my dogecoin from cryptonator at the time when the fee was 1 doge it never happened. They failed my transfer every time and now they have just increase the doge fee.","Was working great at first but once dogecoin shot up it started having serious issues, it's been down for a month and tons of us are still waiting on a reply from you guys, your support isn't doing any supporting at all cause no one has gotten any answers, we're all left in the blind here, sooner or later you guys will have to answer for what you're doing.","Dogecoin went \"offline\" for two weeks, meaning you were unable to access your crypto, so no sending or trading. Completely ridiculous. 100% Scam Service. The value of the coin cut in half in that time. Cryptonator is NOT regulated and charges exorbitant fees. Use Binance or Coinbase instead.","I transferred my 23000 dogecoin in my another wallet in 19th May, but in my cryptonator transaction activity still showing my transaction in pending why? If system is pending from your side so please revert back my transaction. Last so many days I continues sent you reminder on your given mail id, but from your side no any response for me.

Installed the app, it then advises you to back up wallet/ copy seed phrase. Standard and so far so good. Then asks you for your pin. What pin? Haven't been asked to set a pin, so unable to get seed phrase = no way I'm putting my crypto in here. Dodgy as hell. Worse than useless app.","So far very impressed, it's now my go-to wallet app for (mobile) polygon network use. Would be 5 stars if I could find a dark mode option and there were tabs for dapps. Also getting errors when using biometrics but works fine when using pin/pattern.","Doesn't support Polygon Mainnet like advertised. You can use ETH $$ or Binance . Unfortunate because also saw AVAX network on there but, again, doesn't support AVAX Mainnet. Seems like a decent wallet but won't be using because it offers me nothing.","One of the most extensive decentralised self custodian crypto wallets out there.

The problem with casting a wide net like that is that you tend to be average for everything else. Functionality is average. UI isn't as intuitive as it should be, but they will improve it. Like I said, this app has support for so many blockchains it's pretty crazy. Thanks team.","This app was a wonderful piece of tech making everyday trading and dapp usage easier then ever. However recently it has started to crash every time I try to log in, its a nightmare. I belive the new update is the culprit as It only shows me vchain as a possible log in option. (Update) App has been updated and I'm back on track, super happy to be able to access everything without issue again.

You can store, use and swap cryptocurrencies between different blockchains like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), Tezos (XTZ) as well as tokens USDT (ERC20 token), tzBTC (Tezos wrapped Bitcoin), TBTC, WBTC (Ethereum wrapped Bitcoin) without intermediaries from your mobile wallet.\r\n\r\nWhat makes Atomex wallet special?\r\nAtomex Hybrid exchange combines advantages of centralized and decentralized exchanges:\r\n• You're in control: Private keys are kept encrypted on your mobile wallet. Cross-blockchain transactions are carried out using Atomic Swaps.\r\n• No additional fees: You pay only a miner fee for both regular and cross-blockchain atomic swap transactions.\r\n• Stay incognito: No registration or identity verification required because Atomex is a non-custodial cryptocurrency wallet.\r\n• Audited: All blockchain atomic swap smart-contracts and crypto wallet core library audited by LeastAuthority.\r\n• Staking Tezos: Delegate your Tezos (XTZ) to trusted bakers from the Baking Bad list and bring an income.\r\nWhat is Atomic Swap exchange?\r\nAtomic swap is a technology for secure exchange of digital assets without the need to trust a third party. It’s as secure as cryptographic primitives and blockchain implementation it's based on. It's mathematically proved that in every scenario you either succeed with an exchange or get your money back. Atomex uses an on-chain implementation based on hashed timelock smart-contracts.\r\n\r\nHow long does an atomic swap take?\r\nDepending on the chosen pair of cryptocurrency, the exchange may take from several minutes to an hour. The maximum time is 6 hours, after which the coins are returned to your crypto wallet.\r\n\r\nHow are private keys stored?\r\nYour private keys are stored ONLY on your mobile wallet device, encrypted using AES-256. You have to unlock your crypto wallet with the encryption password on every start.\r\n\r\nStaking Tezos\r\nStake Tezos (XTZ) from your own wallet with a delegation function.

You can store, use and swap cryptocurrencies between different blockchains like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), Tezos (XTZ) as well as tokens USDT (ERC20 token), tzBTC (Tezos wrapped Bitcoin), TBTC, WBTC (Ethereum wrapped Bitcoin) without intermediaries from your mobile wallet.<br><br><h2><b>What makes Atomex wallet special?</b></h2><br>Atomex Hybrid exchange combines advantages of centralized and decentralized exchanges:<br><blockquote><b>• You&#39;re in control:</b> Private keys are kept encrypted on your mobile wallet. Cross-blockchain transactions are carried out using Atomic Swaps.</blockquote><br><blockquote><b>• No additional fees:</b> You pay only a miner fee for both regular and cross-blockchain atomic swap transactions.</blockquote><br><blockquote><b>• Stay incognito:</b> No registration or identity verification required because Atomex is a non-custodial cryptocurrency wallet.</blockquote><br><blockquote><b>• Audited:</b> All blockchain atomic swap smart-contracts and crypto wallet core library audited by LeastAuthority.</blockquote><br><blockquote><b>• Staking Tezos:</b> Delegate your Tezos (XTZ) to trusted bakers from the Baking Bad list and bring an income.</blockquote><br><h2><b>What is Atomic Swap exchange?</b></h2><br>Atomic swap is a technology for secure exchange of digital assets without the need to trust a third party. It’s as secure as cryptographic primitives and blockchain implementation it&#39;s based on. It&#39;s mathematically proved that in every scenario you either succeed with an exchange or get your money back. Atomex uses an on-chain implementation based on hashed timelock smart-contracts.<br><br><h2><b>How long does an atomic swap take?</b></h2><br>Depending on the chosen pair of cryptocurrency, the exchange may take from several minutes to an hour. The maximum time is 6 hours, after which the coins are returned to your crypto wallet.<br><br><h2><b>How are private keys stored?</b></h2><br>Your private keys are stored ONLY on your mobile wallet device, encrypted using AES-256. You have to unlock your crypto wallet with the encryption password on every start.<br><br><h2><b>Staking Tezos</b></h2><br>Stake Tezos (XTZ) from your own wallet with a delegation function. It brings passive income automatically. Delegation in Tezos is absolutely safe. Your coins are not locked or frozen and do not move anywhere. You can spend them at any time and without any delay from your Atomex wallet. Just keep in mind, you only delegate your rights, that’s it. Atomex wallet uses Tezos Baking Bad baker’s list.

You are doing nice job.","I must say it's a good one; kudos to the team. Have been using it for a while now yet no issues but one: it just keeps updating. Asides that, it makes carrying out transactions easy as easy can get. UPDATE (12/05/2021) Still same; no change. Have not met with a single issue and the updates are not much again. Well done, guys!","Upgrading my rating for this app from a 2-star to a 4.5-star rating for the following reasons: - the app has a very simple user interface - the team are working tirelessly to expand the app functionality and user experience - more work needs to be done to increase app speed though, and also to minimize errors - other than these, the quidax app is an amazing app. Huge kudos to the team for their wonderful work thus far. Keep doing more guys!","Not impressed with the app at all. It's like you just started what you cannot finish I wonder why crypto transaction fees on this app is so high. Just imagine being charged 60% of the actual amount you want to transfer. Also, I keep getting notifications about the app being updated but still I don't see any changes. I'm beginning to think this app is a scam This is unacceptable.","So far so good, I've been using Quidax wallet for quite a long time and the App has served and keeps serving me well.

The generators. I can no longer buy them. I should start with more than 0 from all my upgrades, and everytime my Auto generator buys them, after 1 second they reset, so I still have no generators. EDIT: It fixed itself a few days ago, so no worries! I think it was just something to do with a setting I had up. Made some good progress now!","Much better than the original. (Edit: Interesting mechanics, though I am getting some slight Antimatter Dimensions vibes with some of them. Now that I played the game a bit, I do see now that much of the game, at least what I'm up to, is centered on challenges, which makes it unique, but also repetitive.)","Great game, the menus could be cleaned up a bit to make it a bit easier to understand (mainly the server menu, also I'm not very far into the game [haven't reached Grand Hardfork yet] so there might be more menus that need the same treatment), haven't experienced any glitches or crashes yet, overall good game. Love the music by the way.","Really calm paced game, easy to maneuver, tutorial right off the start (plus info on every other main item), and easy to play in general. I feel the game may be too fast, with each bit coming and going like speed, but with the third prestige layer coming soon, that'll be nice. 5 stars."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.CryptoGrounds.CryptoClickers2","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.CryptoGrounds.CryptoClickers2&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Bitstamp – Buy & Sell Bitcoin at Crypto Exchange","description":"Buy and sell Bitcoin, Ethereum and other leading cryptocurrencies securely from your phone using your credit card, debit card or bank account!

So you can't add again, or move assets","Most secure app out there because it won't even let you trade after setting up an account that uses your SSN and other secret personal data. You MUST install either Duo Mobile or Google Authenticator in order to trade. The only issue that is giving me problems is that you must exit the app in order to open the authenticator app to plug-in a code and receive a pin#. You then open Bitstamp to enter the pin#. When I open Bitstamp, the pin is denied because the code changes everytime I open the app.","OK app, I find it awkward to adjust the charts using pinch & zoom. Still very useful & UI simple to use. When logging in after updating password the dark theme resets to light. APP NOT CONNECTING TODAY! Reinstalled app - now logged in.","The app is cool but I'd like it to keep track of gains and losses. Furthermore, if you did something different you'd add more customers like allowing recurring buys, direct deposit paychecks or even something like Acorns spare change round-up.","Everything was working ok then the app decided to stop using biometric for no reason.

Layer-2 gives you the best of both worlds: gas-free and ultra-fast, with Ethereum security, opportunity, and global reach.<br><br>DEXES, DEFI &amp; DAPPS<br>Earn, invest, and trade, all at a click. The new decentralized financial system is at your fingertips, and you can put your money to work within your wallet. Deposit assets to layer-2 AMM pools, earn fess and incentives. Compete in swap tournaments, earn rewards. A gateway to the future of finance.<br><br>SECURE, SMART, &amp; IN-CONTROL<br>Completely self-custodial; only you control your assets. Say goodbye to seed phrases and paper backups, say hello to social recovery. Choose a combination of friends, your other wallets (hardware or software), or institutions as guardians of your wallet. If you ever lose access to your mobile, they help you recover your assets. As long as more than half of your guardians are trustworthy, your assets are secure. You can also set limits on daily transfers, and lock your wallet down if ever needed.<br><br>OWN YOUR IDENTITY<br>Decouples identity and security. You can choose your wallet name and address, and maintain this identity forever on Ethereum. Even if a security incident occurs, you can continue to use the same wallet and ensure that all assets on the wallet are secure. Compared to an ordinary wallet where, if the private key is leaked, all your assets are no longer safe.","summary":"The most advanced yet easy-to-use Ethereum wallet.","installs":"5,000+","minInstalls":5000,"maxInstalls":6750,"score":3.6043956,"scoreText":"3.6","ratings":91,"reviews":55,"histogram":{"1":22,"2":6,"3":9,"4":3,"5":51},"price":0,"free":true,"currency":"USD","priceText":"Free","offersIAP":false,"size":"16M","androidVersion":"6.0","androidVersionText":"6.0 and up","developer":"Loopring","developerId":"5678052313470126815","developerEmail":"wallet@loopring.org","developerWebsite":"https://loopring.io","developerAddress":"Road Town, Tortola, British Virgin Islands","privacyPolicy":"https://loopring.io/#/legal/privacy/en","developerInternalID":"5678052313470126815","genre":"Tools","genreId":"TOOLS","icon":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/9e7RHYAMaDER8OP9vHm52RUKXIFDIdITT5NZLJ7osp_9z3tReqMBJLZbRkSwXyynIEYF","headerImage":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/QkhZvfKQZmNDjVh9anclR_E3vlLxky3Wg2nuwrAZ834t2REJ5ZtJjYiWyAyKVn-D2Q","screenshots":["https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/3kjdIEhtMdQO5B2VRLEgfXgjnSB0gOCG0PDgx-paXICqLH474AjuJE_pMIJ5IiVTXCA","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/vghfPSuYPyHyVKBNppcY3J7wvv5TmAgH5UYx7H-PdZcJAr85jsH1ccu1us3m6jWZ7zM","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/U7TKVCq3a_ZnxnW-SE8Ka2AVxCpITyrhwRtM_N8gGIULlTBcIvojxK0zjw6ohM-_XQ"],"contentRating":"Everyone","adSupported":false,"released":"Jan 13, 2021","updated":1625286364000,"version":"1.0.92","recentChanges":"Fix several minor user experience issues","comments":["The developers need to add a bit more info to help users understand the cost of L1 transactions using a smart wallet. But the added security (daily limits, guardians and whitelisted addresses) and the peace of mind it provides are worth every penny in gas fees. Also, the loopring team is very talented and responsive.","27$ to create a wallet is a terrible model when there are far better other free wallets to utilize, such as those that allow you to partake in dapps and cost nothing to setup. I have assets pooled in the loop ring DEX using a different wallet and when eth 2.0 is released, or the gas fees lower in price, I'm pulling out. It's not user friendly, it doesn't appeal to a wide enough base.","Good wallet but do NOT set it up when eth gas is high: the ethereum fee to create this wallet can be extremely high (hundreds of dollars potentially).. if gas is high just use a more traditional wallet and connect it to exchange.loopring.io. loopring is great.","at time of writing $+1000 open account wallet, potentially re-endeavour in future however, has un-installed for now; w/out proceeding past $1000+ fee.","I really wanted to like this but ultimately felt bitter. Once you transfer funds, you are forced to move your funds to the loooring 2 wallet, which can be anywhere from $70 to $100usd fee. You cannot do anything unless you do this. You can't even swap, or send funds. Even if you have the loopring token! You guys have to be upfront with these things and make it crystal clear to all newcomers.

Add haptic feedback too when buttons are pressed. .... In the digit input screen, pull or bring down the keypad a bit — there's a large unused space at the bottom. EDIT: 5 stars to 3 stars. why?

I would give it 5 stars but the graph data is almost always wrong. Sometimes it's off just a bit and other times it's off a lot. Like today, graphs shown next to each coin show a sharp, temporary dip but when you go into that coin to view the graph, it does not show that dip.","This app couldn't be better. One thing that I love about this app is that it doesn't require you to log in or sign up as I'm using it only to check the prices of some coins that I have purchased from a different app. The widget is lovely and the numbers are clear and I love its ability to give notifications once a coin reaches a certain amount. Removing the ads is worth your two dollars. All in all, PERFECT! 👏","This is the best functionality of all the ones I've tried, however, it is a bit buggy. Sometimes the coins on the widget disappear and you have to hit refresh. Not a big deal but it does happen. Also, sometimes when I click on a coin in the widget and it opens in the app, it opens to the last thing I was looking at and not that coin. I'd be happy to work with support.","Everything is great, I also bought the ad free pro version. Just one BIG downside in widget, I'm not able to find any option for auto refresh (pro versions in few crypto apps do offer a feature where widget prices refresh automatically within the time interval you select). I know it can affect battery life, but i hope you can offer an upgrade with that feature with user having a choice to keep it off, or select auto refresh intervals like 2, 5, 10 mins, etc. Else it was 5 star for me","Ads are too frequent unless you pay. I had to edit as the developers think we are slow and don't understand the obvious. Devs - we know you want money and don't care about the people who use your software for free, but this is where your customer base comes from.

It simplifies the process of connecting to Defi Apps on Ethereum (ETH), Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Houbi ECO Chain (HECO), and Tomochain (TOMO).\r\n\r\nFor instance, KEYRING PRO lets you sign and approve transactions on supported chains simultaneously directly from your phone. It basically means you can manage everything in one place effortlessly.\r\n\r\nAll you need to do is to scan a QR Code then sign in. No Extension needed!\r\nMost popular Dapps now support Wallet Connect as Uniswap, 1INCH Exchange, Pancake Swap, MDEX, Sushi Swap, etc.\r\n\r\n✔KEYRING PRO Focuses On Non-Custodial Wallet Management for Bitcoin Wallet (BTC), Ether Wallet (ETH), BSC Wallet (Binance Smart Chain), HECO Wallet (Houbi ECO Chain), and TOMO Wallet (TomoChain)\r\n\r\nThe app mainly helps users to interact with Dapps on different platforms via Wallet Connect Feature, rather than playing the role of a regular Crypto Wallet. \r\n\r\nIn fact, you can check your Total Holding Value on all supported chains directly on the Home screen of the app, or make transactions on a dedicated site of KEYRING PRO.\r\n\r\n✔Never lose access to your funds on Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Houbi ECO Chain (HECO), and TomoChain (TOMO), ever.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time, as you dive deeper into the Blockchain World, the number of your owning addresses will increase significantly.

DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE Once again I have to file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau.","Super easy to use. Nice to be able to fund asap unlike a lot of other exchanges or custodians. Entry to the crypto space is great. Following areas of improvement: the \"Slide/Swipe\" to buy is a bit weird as I'd prefer something like a button with less motion. The app could be made more snappier. Scrolling left/right to holdings performance is a bit weird. But aside from all that, I'm a fan of the product and business model. THE INTEREST IS JUST AWESOME 😎.","Be ready to pay a premium. You will always buy at the ask price and sell at the bid price. The difference on the app is 2-5%. So potentially u will lose 5% when you buy and when you sell. Most good exchanges the difference is way less than .05%... Here you are in the hole 10% by the time you cash out. Crypto withdrawal fees are highest in business as well.. over $40 for some tokens, compared to $2-4 for others. That said the app is very easy to use and UI is great. Worth it?- you decide","#SHIBARMY ALL THE WAY! Thanks for listing! Update: After posting my review I read others and I am confused with the latest comments.

Don't know what they mean, Voyager is one of the easiest apps to invest in crypto.","Started off okay. Not sure about the fees but my issue is that I can't log in or change my password due to \"internal server issues\". This has been going on for weeks now.

I really wanted to give 5 stars but the app failed to update after a recent transaction stating that I am offline. I found that I had to clear cache then restart, for it to work properly. Therefore only 4 stars for now. EDIT: after trying the built-in exchange I have removed another star from my review. Like others described before me the fees are higher than expected. DO NOT use the exchange service.","Easy to use, high transaction fees (but that's the bitcoin miner fee, it's the same no matter what wallet is used), only thing keeping it from being 5 stars is the fact that the minimum for exchanging altcoims is 52 euro which is quite high (as in, if I want to convert BTC to etherium, I have to convert a minimum of 52 euro worth) but overall a good, safe, easy to use app.","Wallet fees are ridiculous. Total Wallet amounts sometimes freeze so you have to reload multiple times for aggregate dollar amounts to show correctly. Ain't nobody got time for that foolishness. Update 5/5/2021: Based on feedback from Jaxx I will adjust my overall rating from 2 stars to 3 stars. If Jaxx can improve the crypto aggregate so that it's more reliable I will adjust my rating again. Thank you for your feedback. That piece of information you shared is helpful for my understanding.","Not good for new users. I tried to move and then trade around $400 USD of crypto coins and it says there is not enough money to do the transaction. The money is stuck there. This apparently this is nothing to do the makers of the wallet but they could have given some indication this was the case. I am new the crypto but I has no idea it costs more than $400 to move coins to another wallet or to an exchange.

This scam app is easy to recieve the cripto, but very hard to get It back or make any payments over it due to the hidden minimum amount which you can see only before the last step and which is way more then the purchase amount. Have just lost my $15 for nothing. Burn in hell, scamers!","Edit* The app is an absolute joke. CoinPayments support is 50/50 I feel some support agents can be more sarcastic or ignorent than others. To convert your coins you must have £50-£60 worth them which is absurd. To transfer coins the fees extortionate. They say there is no hidden fees etc and its Tx fees but you can send crypto from wallets like Coinbase, Nash & Blockchain without fees that high. I'd recommend any new users to fully avoid CoinPayments unless you want a large %of your crypto gone","I can't access acct. There is no option other then scan qr. This is a joke. .36 short and I'm being strong armed $5 in \"fees\" to make up the amount needed bc btc price went up. So not fair. You guys have it setup so no support is available.

Not to mention the lack of basis portfolio visualization features and the fact we have two different apps from the same company.","Very disappointing app. I thought pro meant it was going to give me a lot of control over charts and indicators, but it's way too basic. I tried Binance and it provides a rich experience with a lot of customizability. I can actually zoom in and out and drag charts around, rather than this which is just fixed. Not trader friendly at all.","Absolutely horrible platform! I had $110 in Eth and tried to withdrawal some to pay someone. Turns out the authenticator had issues, I had to get my account unlocked, now I can't withdraw my money. Customer service is non-existent with coin base either. I can't reach anyone and my support tickets continue to get rejected. If I could speak with someone that could help me resolve this issue then i would be ok with the situation. Do yourself a favor and use another platform like Gemini or binance.","Garbage! Constantly freezing, especially when switching between apps. Constantly getting logged out and when I try to log back in I get a rate limit exceeded message that even by changing password I still can't log in and get same error, waited about an hour, uninstalled and still no progress. Trying to log on through web browser and it just loads and loads with the same stupid blue lines just chilling in the middle of the screen with no progress. This happens often, I regret transfer my funds","Used to be good. Now it doesn't even load past the title screen. Desktop app doesn't load at all. It's been almost a week and I can't get a reply from anybody for customer support, so I guess that's goodbye to my $2000.

Responses come in weeks or months not hours and every time it is the same problem again and again. Stay clear.","This company is so bad. I emailed them over a month ago asking for some help because I was locked out of my account Due to their system. I have all of my passwords and my passkey and I know they are correct. I got an email back from support and they said that another part of the company handles this and they are forwarding my email and this was a month ago. DO NOT DOWNLOAD OR USE THIS APP. THERE IS NO CUSTOMER SERVICE IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG!!!","This is probably the worst wallet available for Ethereum right now. It is cumbersome to use, they make every change without notice (Which made it impossible to access on the computer), they do not support sending anything somewhat irregular, the transaction fees are insanely expensive (Compared to setting one's own gas price), there is no way to access the wallet anywhere else and it is all a hassle. I rarely write reviews for apps, but this wallet is truely deserving of it.","At this point it'd be easier to use an apple //e for NFTs. Can't set up an account going on 9 days now.

A couple times it'd pull up the captcha, but told me I was wrong.","Some free transactions are great, but only if you can get past the bugs and transactions that you initiate and then dapper takes over and decides you want to send 0 funds but still use the free transaction.

There is also a BTC mining option to get free BTC!!","I love this app I love the fact that you can mine for bitcoins without having to have a supercomputer it is easy it is quick it doesn't use all your battery and it do it in the background best app ever","I love the ease of use! It makes it easy to find the right fund and also as an investor in the company it was a good choice. Simple enough for people that are not super knowledgeable on Cryptocurrency.","Great app! Makes investing easy. The only thing that's slightly annoying is that when you click on a portfolio in the invest tab, the portfolio details seem to be cut off mid-sentence for some reason.","I've been using this fund for quite some time and have found that the investment returns are great. One of the most notable things recently is that even though Bitcoin had a huge selloff and price reduction recently these guys were able to see it coming and reallocate the funds they had me invested in and my investment avoided being a part of the selloff.

They charge a hefty fee and it's impossible to find out how they calculate the charges. Their math doesn't match the rules taught at schools and their shameless claims that they don't charge for trading is a scam. Even after complaining to support they act as if it was in my interest to be charged hidden charges. The app and their website are buggy. They should not be allowed to take people's money.","Can't login for last two days !!!","THINK TWICE BEFORE PUTTING YOUR MONEY INTO THIS PLATFORM.
