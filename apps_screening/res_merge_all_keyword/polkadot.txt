The problem with casting a wide net like that is that you tend to be average for everything else. Functionality is average. UI isn't as intuitive as it should be, but they will improve it. Like I said, this app has support for so many blockchains it's pretty crazy. Thanks team.","This app was a wonderful piece of tech making everyday trading and dapp usage easier then ever. However recently it has started to crash every time I try to log in, its a nightmare. I belive the new update is the culprit as It only shows me vchain as a possible log in option. (Update) App has been updated and I'm back on track, super happy to be able to access everything without issue again. Thanks guys.","One of the best wallet I have ever seen in last 7 years, 23 different blockchain by default added. Very good and easy to use....thnx","Works well and does everything i need.

Some coins do work, like Bitcoin, but BCH was transferred to this wallet and even after checking the block explorer and seeing that there were 50 confirmations, still no log of the transfer even after 7 hours. People in the U.S. need to keep track of this for tax purposes but it's not too reliable. I'm not sure about all of the coins but LTC is another one that should be examined. Thanks.","Works well keeping in mind its Binance on the Binance blockchains. It does Ethereum Mainnet as well, but will not allow DEX between blockchains. Also will not allow swap between blockchains. So if you have ETH or USDT and want BTC (or visa versa) this will not work for you. Otherwise it is a nice wallet that pays interest on a few held assets (mostly BNB).","It would be the perfect wallet if it had more Binance Smart Chain coin swap options. Dapp browser conflicts with Android Web View sometimes causing loading of exchanges to slow down immensely. Support for ease of access to exchanges is incredible and top quality. In App Price chart is slow to reflect real-time value and tends to lag behind the real time value of coins 9/10 times. In App buy minimum to fund the wallet is painfully high most times. Suggest sending funds to wallet from elsewhere","So far My experience using the trust wallet app has been very good I must admit.... BUT, BUT, BUT your continuous habit of deleting users transaction history/ID everytime the app is updated is a big FAILURE , y'all really need to find a solution to this issue... There isn't any backup feature which allows TX history/ID to be saved & this can be a big issue for many users from different parts of the globe.... As a early user of TW having access to my TX history/ID is very important .... Pls Fix","I was initially a little upset with Trust Wallet because of some issues I was having, but they have great customer service! Now that I know how to fully use the app, it is very easy and I like it. Edit: I lowered my review to 3 stars. I have used a lot of crypto apps and this is definitely the most difficult one to use.

However, due to an issue with the mobile version of metamask I cannot log in to Shopping.io and connect my wallet.

I know the more contact you have with more iot devices and such allows for more rewards but I teach in a classroom and of course a school with 200+ students and I have accumulated 1/10th of a nodle cash token in 2.5 months. It's fairly measley in my opinion. Love the concept though!!","I earned a bunch of nodle cash and it stopped accruing one day. After a few days I figured out this was happening to others and it needed updated. I updated and it took everything. This would not happen on a legitimate project, how many others did this happen to that didn't leave a review. I was pretty happy with what I was earning, really liked the concept of this and looked into it extensively. I was really excited to see where this project would go. Then an update took everything.","Super neat little app. Doesn't slow my phone or drain the battery very much at all. I'd recommend managing your expectations. You're not gonna make a boat load of money off your phone being a node but as a crypto hobbyist, this app hits a really great sweet spot.","I've transferred over 60,000 packets in ludicrous mode. Rewards still say 0.0 earned. I've turned battery optimization off and have the app allowed to run in background, but it never works in the background. If you leave the app open, it works for a few minutes, then you need to close and reopen to get it going again. Not sure what the problem is, but looks like I'm not the only one.","I know this is just your copy & paste response but the app already has permission to run in the background while using mobile data, what other reason do you have for this ridiculously low earning rate? Don't waste your time. I've had it on ludicrous mode since I've downloaded the app, have over 325,000 packets and have made just over 2 tenths of one coin, which is insane considering it has absolutely no value"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"io.nodle.cash","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.nodle.cash&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"EOS TERMINAL CLOUD MINER","description":"EOS TERMINAL CLOUD MINER is a simulator of real mining inside EOS blockchain!\r\n\r\namazing terminal layout\r\nmany commands\r\nfunny to use\r\nconstantly updates\r\n\r\nEnjoy it be a real miner!\r\n\r\nIt is very important that all users are aware that to use this application the cryptocurrency named \"EOS\" must be legal in their country of residence, and that the developers of this application are not responsible otherwise.\r\n\r\nThis app doesn't perform any real \"mining\" activity and doesn't damage your phone hardware because it get data from remote control only.","descriptionHTML":"EOS TERMINAL CLOUD MINER is a simulator of real mining inside EOS blockchain!<br><br>amazing terminal layout<br>many commands<br>funny to use<br>constantly updates<br><br>Enjoy it be a real miner!<br><br>It is very important that all users are aware that to use this application the cryptocurrency named &quot;EOS&quot; must be legal in their country of residence, and that the developers of this application are not responsible otherwise.<br><br>This app doesn&#39;t perform any real &quot;mining&quot; activity and doesn&#39;t damage your phone hardware because it get data from remote control only.","summary":"Try the experience to a real mining simulation for EOS","installs":"10,000+","minInstalls":10000,"maxInstalls":22704,"score":4,"scoreText":"4.0","ratings":2090,"reviews":1123,"histogram":{"1":274,"2":58,"3":176,"4":461,"5":1118},"price":0,"free":true,"currency":"USD","priceText":"Free","offersIAP":false,"size":"16M","androidVersion":"4.4","androidVersionText":"4.4 and up","developer":"Flying Mining","developerId":"Flying+Mining","developerEmail":"blkcodedevelopers@gmail.com","developerWebsite":"https://ltccloudminer.advcrypt.com/app-ads.txt","privacyPolicy":"http://advcrypt.com/eosterminalminer/privacy.html","developerInternalID":"7523429579459012061","genre":"Simulation","genreId":"GAME_SIMULATION","icon":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Ok2hCgDSadu6feDY1SMhy_Vy1e14_iMg8IQ3GXWUAIoqMPQamjy5hdDR63r2wLb3Xw","headerImage":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/R2ann2FOCKMm-kP6CAwqOhQb94ZwdoeLGn_0Lzkz4YTboJ8PCpFuMNAyjH-Ti08X27Q","screenshots":["https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/sqMCGy8gLQwwPOpVb5QQh5U3tIPgl0v1anMeM2YC64Q0-es-EUUni-YYXdE1SjQV9_M","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/v6A3V7V6q0qYxrNNrz8JSpQSf4xJcAuE__awJhiBGRyGScX9W9H3fBQqbbGXjmxFLM4","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/KWdRkSqZvOVLIVaH1st9eEkcFxIIRvis-dg4ntaOsOb8IpTF9gH95ni5sAPdesHAKdo6","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/IObatWfZhf1d1axDYLNO5aDMXXU2T553-qQElxo-Bj4LE3curJNpXTx18ToSGIFvJeE"],"contentRating":"Everyone","adSupported":true,"released":"Apr 21, 2020","updated":1587480019000,"version":"1.1","recentChanges":"Version 1.1","comments":["I will have to try this app again, because I don't understand it.

It's a 1.0 version so the developer will likely make an improved version in the future. Some feedback I have for the developer is to change the claim/restart time intervals from every 30 mins (length of time to mine 1 block) to every 3 hours and have a notification alert that pops up, reminding users when to claim/restart mining. Would be great if there was a mode that would continue to mine while you're asleep. Needs both \"-\" \"X\" buttons to mimimize/close the program.","I enjoy it so far, but why does it always flip the app on my phone. So my phone can only be viewed upside down.

Email reset won't send. App is up to date. No response other than an automated email saying there was a problem and to update. Concerned my account was compromised and whomever is having all the time in the world to steal my money and identity. AT BEST Voyager has stolen $100 plus dollars from me. DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE Once again I have to file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau.","Super easy to use. Nice to be able to fund asap unlike a lot of other exchanges or custodians. Entry to the crypto space is great. Following areas of improvement: the \"Slide/Swipe\" to buy is a bit weird as I'd prefer something like a button with less motion. The app could be made more snappier. Scrolling left/right to holdings performance is a bit weird. But aside from all that, I'm a fan of the product and business model. THE INTEREST IS JUST AWESOME 😎.","Be ready to pay a premium. You will always buy at the ask price and sell at the bid price. The difference on the app is 2-5%. So potentially u will lose 5% when you buy and when you sell. Most good exchanges the difference is way less than .05%... Here you are in the hole 10% by the time you cash out. Crypto withdrawal fees are highest in business as well.. over $40 for some tokens, compared to $2-4 for others. That said the app is very easy to use and UI is great. Worth it?- you decide","#SHIBARMY ALL THE WAY! Thanks for listing! Update: After posting my review I read others and I am confused with the latest comments. I've used Voyager for about a month and a half and it has been nothing but a great app. I have never experienced any lag on transferring fiat to and from the app. Never any issues with buying or converting crypto; no issues what so ever. Don't know what they mean, Voyager is one of the easiest apps to invest in crypto.","Started off okay. Not sure about the fees but my issue is that I can't log in or change my password due to \"internal server issues\". This has been going on for weeks now. Absolutely no access to my account and crypto.

I think they need to make it more clear that those arrows on the side are the send and receive buttons. I think they should also display your balance first before they show the price of the cryptocurrency. What I mean is that instead of having to switch to see your balance I think you should have to switch to see the price of what ever cryptocurrency you are on. Other than those two things the app is amazing! 😄👏🏼","This wallet is all we need. More and more coins are added and the best part is that this wallet is user friendly.

Keep it up exodus, cheers!","Slider shows wrong value when you are at 6 months scope - how can be peak of a price graph be 30 while the dip is 50? I do remember when I bought but it is about money it really shouldn't show wrong values. Nice design. I would like to see auto note about price when I did recive or send. And my average - just a lil bit of analytics. ( any price graph has this bug - it is more apparent with scope 1+ month)","The app is indeed very convenient; its design is well suited for everyday crypto needs, however the problem on my phone (which is running Android 8.1) is that the app requires more CPU and RAM resources than the phone is okay dealing with, which results in a significant delay when loading the UI screen for each requested functionality; in short - it's slow. Other than that it's a great tool to have. For legit advice on acquiring Bitcoin with zero investment see cb.run/earn-bitcoin-free","Exodus is by far the best wallet when it comes to UI/UX.

SoFi does not respond to emails at all, ever. It took a public Twitter message to get a response, and then they didn't even try to help me with it, just your pre-packaged \"we've forwarded the issue to our engineers!\" because that's ever true of any company. Unfortunately SoFi doesn't actually want your business, so better to go elsewhere.","I like having information on my cash, savings, credit, and investment accounts all in one place is nice. The tiles are a bit overwhelming at times though, something a little more minimalist and clean with a clear path to certain aspects of the app would be great. I occasionally feel lost when navigating through Relay and Money. The spending snapshot for relay is great, but I would like to be able to set spending budgets for each category in the future. Good app, great company.","I've done a few reviews on this app, but I felt the need to start fresh. This app is frustrating. They keep adding features, except those to to actually improve the app. There are no graphs to track your portfolio performance and you cannot do Stop loss orders or anything more advanced than a limit order. Also, the graphs on the stocks themselves rarely load. Just a spinning loading image. I'm continuously looking at other brokerages.","I actually really like this app, it's really user-friendly.

Disappointing and have switched to using the Fidelity app which provides the same features I was looking for without the ads. Just because the app is FREE doesn't justify full screen advertisements. There are plenty of free apps that are able to deliver advertising in a less obtrusive manner.","App seems ok but not used for long. Almost immediately after installing the app I had a cold call to my mobile and then received an email. Both from the company running the app. I'd only downloaded it to check the price and ask for an alert on some specific shares ( the only ones I own). Not impressed on how they exploited my contact details. I have uninstall the app.","Would be a more usefull tool if, when minimised, the app would stay in my minimised views section on my phone. It does not, it disappears as soon as I view anything else and, when I minimise that , to re-view investing app...the page has gone and I then have to go and re-start investing app and wait for yet another ad to load (which I, and almost everyone I know closes right away anyway) and then find what I was looking at before. In a trading situation, that is highly unfavourable. More work","Love the UI, push notifications are really meaningful, do not waste my time, the frequency is just right, helps quickly decide if I want to read the article in detail or just move on. Thanks to the Product, design and dev teams!","I think that this app is very useful. But, because my vision isn't what it used to be, I have my phone's font set as slightly larger than normal. This greatly affects the aesthetics of the app in a negative way. I made it smaller, so it could be beautiful, but it slightly strains my eyes to look at it.

In this update:<br>- Bug fixes &amp; improvements","comments":["I really enjoy the app! I use the card for purchases I would make like gas and snack food because you get a little CRO back so I thought why not. Buying coins is easy as well. The only part I don't really understand is the card tiers say you need a minimum staked in dollars to go up a tier, but then when I go to stake there is a minimum written in CRO or whatever other coin I've tried staking. Other than that I really enjoy the app and if you're wanting a debit card for crypto, this one works!","App is not incredibly intuitive, but it's still pretty solid. Only 3 stars because app doesn't work at all in newest version of Android beta, which is currently preventing me from accessing my investments. Reduced another star (now 2) as it's not been a month since the Android 12 beta went public and has even had an update, but this app has still not been fixed. It's the only app that I've encountered that does not work in the beta.","I purchased crypto worth $3,520. I was showing this amount but when the transaction complete I was charged a fee even though it did not show the box where I have to check it and agree to the fee. I contact customer service many times but no luck I told them it was a glitch on their end but the customer service is like a robot.. they just copy and paste.. total scam I do not recommend it. I am in a process to cancel my account.","This is the most complicated app I've ever dealt with for crypto buying selling and tracking. It's takes forever, selling and trading is extremely confusing. Only reason I am using it is ability to buy diverse coins. 1 star is very harsh, but its obvious this app is designed for the educated when it comes to crypto, people new to crypto currency would be better served going somewhere else. Trading, buying, or transferring needs to be made more simple .","Overall the app is nice, that is if you get to open it! I've been using it for 6m now and would like to see faster replies from the customer service agents and limit orders when buying coins. Ah, I didn't get my referral credit too. A bit more generous rewards for staking would be appreciated too. Other than that, it has a nice selection of coins and it's quite easy to use."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"co.mona.android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.mona.android&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Eidoo: Bitcoin and Ethereum Wallet and Exchange","description":"Eidoo.

The metaverse is growing, the wallet is more refined and faster than ever, and the integrations including jumpnet are compounding. Not just for enjin but a must if you use their ecosystem!","Great wallet, it's easy and it's secure. I use it to store my NFTS on that I use for games such as Forgotten Artifacts and Space Misfits. The QR scanner helps a lot as well in order to transfer NFTS from one address to another in a fast way without writing down the whole address. It's also been easy for me to sell things on the wallet through Enjinx by simply going to my NFT hitting sell on any NFT I want to sell that is in the multiverse. good better best wallet wow wow wow","Update: Significant improvement in speed and exchange fees. Thanks for working on it. Previous: Takes Deposits no problem. The moment you try to withdraw or exchange, endless problems. Part of this rating is their choice of Exchange. Changelly sucks huge. Changelly Dynamic sends tyrannical KYC notices for small transactions where KYC is not legally required. Changelly is trying to falsely obtain people's personal information. Changelly also has unreasonable minimums. Thx","Extremely promt reply. I had gotten a new phone and couldn't figure out how to get into my wallet.

Maybe they are just 'busy' but it's been two weeks since I submitted my ticket and I still haven't conversed with a human! Ergo, one star because the app installs. Nothing more as my BTC are still yet to be found since I 'smart' transferred them in. I would avoid this app at the present time based solely on the support experience. [edit] Support ticket#333616 has been responded to - thank you - +1 more star. [edit#2] - you mention refund but the ticket says the partner has all the info and to create a new PAYIN BTC. All very confusing. We will see. [edit#3]. They eventually refunded me, however based on this experience I still cannot recommend nor give > 2 stars - especially when they ask me to edit the review. If I had enough funds I would transfer what little BTC I have elsewhere and close the account.","For the most part I like the app alot. I transferred in out and exchanged numerous times with no problems. It's always worked smoothly before.....I sent 14.9 xrp \"with the correct tag number included\" ......and never recieved the xrp.

And why? I've never seen another app exchange ever have these issues. The date and time that was requested for payout or exchange should be honored. It was offered to the users as functional, and hasn't been the case on your end as promised.. These excuses are not acceptable. Compensation seems appropriate for start.","Apparently, the WORST app ever. Been trying to sign up since forever. I've re-installed the app severally.

I gave it 4 stars because it is not completely perfect to use and navigate, transaction history does not reflect all the transactions made by me whether it is sending or receiving coins and I wish the notifications of this app is working or is it just me because I am using an older version of android 8. I hope you can fix this and overall it is a good app not great.","This has got to be the worst crypto wallet I've ever used. Tons of bugs and glitches, complicated staking procedures, and the fees are very high. On top of that I lost coins due to a problem with the wallet and customer service is simply incapable of understanding my problem or helping. My advice would be to stay away from this app.","Works well for me and I do recommend. Sometimes it takes a little time for transactions to go through but this is true for most transactions of this type. One thing to makes sure is you keep enough etherum to pay for the transaction if that is what is used for the fees. So just don't zero it out is what I am saying.","Great app for a beginner, such as myself. More up and coming coins need to be added. The ability to sell and trade coins directly thru the wallet would make it the best on the market. And if you really want to solidify #1 spot, bring the community of AWC users together like they've done on my favorite trading platform.","Great app, easy to use. So many nice features. Could use some added features. It's hard to know what your total returns on investments is since it doesn't keep track of where you stared. Haven't had great success in identifying if I've made anything on my staking crypto either.

Can't get to my original wallet, when I do a recovery ( like I was instructed to) I get a new wallet with 0 balance. I email the problem to customer service and it takes them 3 months to get back to me with the exact same instructions. NOW I HAVE 4 WALLETS WITH O BALANCE!! My money is in my original which I still can't get them to give me any way to access it. Bottom line ...don't trust them with your money! I have talked to others that have the same problem. Don't trust Abra!","Nothing special about its features. The interest earning options require a KYC application with Prime Trust. My application was pending for over 2 months with no explanation. My repeated attempts to get more information resulted in automated, bot generated emails, and no action. ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE customer service!!! At least I was able to take my BTC out.","They are saying that it's wallet has it's own unique recovery phrase, but when I login in my recovery phrase I can't recover my account anymore, my investment was gone. I did my verification of identity but it stuck me, there's no way to proceed. hoping they will improve their system. I've lost my 300 Canadian dollars. it was.","Why does it all me to update my app all the time when there is no update available? They claim no fees but they get you on the spread. Comes out close to what Coinbase charges, only CB is transparent about it. I've had the app for 3 days but got a message today saying I had to update it to use it. So I go to update it. There's no update available. You can't do limit orders.","Multiple attempts over the past four months to verify KYC proved futile, even when app confirms successful completion of verification process. All requests for assistance through Abra's customer service yield no results in rectifying the issue. Not only does it take customer service, in average, three weeks to respond to inquiries, but their response is always the same; to follow the app step by step guide to complete KYC verification."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.plutus.wallet","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.plutus.wallet&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Quicrypto: Earn Crypto & Free Bitcoin","description":"Join Quicrypto to earn free Bitcoin (BTC) or any cryptocurrency.\r\n\r\nQuicrypto offers a perfect solution for people who want to earn Bitcoin (BTC) and other crypto without spending any money.

Used to be good. Then they removed nano, which made sense at the time because of the spam attack. Then it got fixed but nano never returned. You can now ONLY withdraw bitcoin and it's worth like one third the amount you used to get. The \"latest updates\" you see on the google play page is false advertising, front and center. Don't know why they get away with it. Cherry on top - the support team has called it quits.","Used to be good, now insanely low rewards and forces you to pay the BTC miner fees, so you get next to nothing after a ton of work.","Pretty good app, at least it used to be before the pointless (pun intended) update where the points earned no longer go towards Nano currency. Now it's only super inflated Bitcoin where earnings are so low that you couldn't afford even a can of beans after what you would make in a month's time. Not too happy but devs use this comment and take it as a learning experience. Fix your app. You will have my patience and kindness.","Not bad for the type of app it is. Avoid Pollfish surveys as they will lead you through a full length survey then not reward anything. InBrain surveys are hit or miss whether they reward anything at all leading them to be a time sink. Theorem Reach surveys will typically award at least something. The other app related opportunities pretty much don't reward anything. Update: seems all the surveys are now done by Lucid, which requires a lot of unnecessary cookies allowing them to track too much.","3 stars - I've had a lot of fun in the past year with this app, I've made over 50$ btc in my free time playing games, just make sure whichever offer wall you use has a customer support section. When points don't come through you have to email the offer wall for customer service. You also have to email Quicrypto customer service if you need to change your wallet address [annoying, but they are nice and helpful] these days the app is glitchy and good offers are hard to find.

Stay tuned for the big update!","comments":["It's a beautiful app. Setup is gorgeous. Functions are extremely helpful. It a great way to keep a general idea of what's going on without having to sit down with my spreadsheets. Unfortunately it doesn't update well and the open trades from most exchanges won't show up. If they do, it's only for BTC. Love this app, don't get me wrong. It's just needs some improvement and I cannot wait for it. (Paid user)","Overall great app and easy to use. But there is a bug in the Custom Alert when you edit the notes in what Coin and save it, the notes from other Coin appears to a different Coin. So I have to refresh it or go to a different tab then switch back to make it look how it should be. I also hope to have an option to add a device since I use two devices to keep track the whole day. There is also some needs for improvement when updating the main, and including graphs in the widget.","I used the free version for a couple of days, and felt like the pro would have some edge. Boy, how wrong was I, it's fantastic! You can connect it to all your wallets, exchanges, websites, etc. And have a holistic view of detailed one on your cryptos and portfolio. Now I can easily know, where I'm losing or making money. I highly recommend this app. Worth every penny, especially if you consider the competition that offers less of more money.","Really great app! I like the ability to get a complete view of my portfolios without having to go to each individual exchange app. The daily (customizable time) report is really cool too! I've been using it for around 4 months now without any issues. I highly recommend CoinStats!!! 👍","My sister likes this app so I thought I'd try it. She has an Apple phone & her app alerts settings offers a sound option so she uses \"Choo choo\" sound to not miss any alerts. I have a Samsung Note 20 Ulltra but the app doesn't offer any sound options. We're both using free option so far. Does anyone know why? 3 stars because of this but I'll update if resolved."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.coinstats.crypto.portfolio","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coinstats.crypto.portfolio&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"ZenGo Crypto & Bitcoin Wallet: Buy, Earn & Trade","description":"Buy Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Tezos (XTZ), Dogecoin and many more assets.

Beautiful UX with just one star off for some minor bugs, that are only bothersome sometimes, otherwise don't effect the overall usage of the app/wallet.

While they say \"no fees\" on trades, you'll notice your purchase/sell has a large fee when you review the order. Additionally, they keep dropping interest rates on their coins. Update 05/19: Blockfi blocked all transactions today for several hours. Update 06/14: Blockfi added an \"administration fee\" on all interest that you make.

The fastest way to obtain bitcoins is to purchase them in person or at a Bitcoin ATM for cash. Bitcoin ATMs allow bitcoins to be purchased for cash,  and some also allow cash withdrawals from Bitcoin wallets stored on smartphones. Participants in online exchanges offer bitcoin buy and sell bids.\r\n# Bitcoin Wallets - Bitcoin uses public-key cryptography, in which a pair of a public and a private cryptographic key is generated. A collection of keys is called a wallet. Note that sometimes the term is used to mean the software in the sense of digital wallet. A Bitcoin transaction transfers ownership to a new address, a string having the form of random letters and numbers derived from public keys by application of a hash function and encoding scheme.\r\n# Ways to buy Cryptocurrencies and Bitcoins - Buy bitcoins using paypal, credit card, Bank Transfer or buy bitcoins using Cash.

Then for some reason sometime within the last month the exchange has gotten really bad. Both PC and mobile app. Disconnecting every 30 secs or whenever there is a spike or dump, coincidentally. The exchange takes forever to load up, if it ever does, so I'm constantly closing and restarting to try and fix it. Can't recommend this exchange for people looking to trade","Everything was great, at first. However, the last 3 days that I've been on has been a nightmare! The service will freeze up (Android, iPhone, website) and it has caused me to liquidate 3 times now! I've lost over $1,000 due to this \"glitch\", so just beware! :Edit: Edit: It has been several weeks with no response. I've reached out again and was told that my ticket would hopefully get expedited soon. That was a week ago. I don't think anyone is trying to help me.","Liked the app until I saw you can't withdrawal money very easy at all. The minimum is high to be able to transfer. I feel like that's how people steal people's money. I hate putting bad reviews. I'm going to change it once you've changed that.

The exchange was one of the most exciting features with the wallet. swipe wallet WAS my one-stop-shop for everything crypto, but now I have to find other services... sad to see this UNEXPECTED change.","This app is clearly riddled with technical issues and not currently fit for purpose. Steer clear or enter at your financial peril. GBP for UK customers was removed, exchange was removed and I am still waitibg to be able to withdraw my money, the customer service and technical team haven't got a clue and the system needs a complete overhaul as so many features lack functionality & letting what was potentially a good wallet down. Your money is certainly at more risk than you can imagine.💔","Used to be one of my primary wallets, since they were taken over by Binace they took out the cards and the exchange, also raised the withdrawal minimum. Plus the app has a lot of bugs in the current version. At this moment, a no go for me.","Refused to open since the new update. Since yesterday that I updated it when it requested that I update it as I tried to login, the app has refused to open fully and log me in. But aside that it has always good.","Poor customer service (bad understanding of the questions asked, answers sometimes not even related to the question...), no card available in France. Non-cardholders are locked out of the application and can only withdaw. Unless their cryptos are under the minimum amount set by swipe, then it means these funds are locked in indefinitely.

I appreciate the app very much as it is very helpful to keep track of my crypto assets. Hopefully with the next update I can give it 5*.","The buttons are unresponsive, and there is a long lag time.

Also, when scrolling between portfolios, the process lags as well with a blank screen coming up when I try to scroll between portfolios instead of seeing the actual portfolio. This is highly frustrating. I would like a developer to please get in contact with me. Having to tap these buttons 10x over for just one action is really grating. Awful user experience.","Be warned: They double charged me for one deposit. And they STILL have not fixed the problem for me 2 months later. They refer me to their financial company whom then gives me the run around. Eventually they said a refund was coming but it never came. They seem very unorganized at best, and possibly fraudulent at worst. I will not be depositing another dollar into this company. I do NOT recommend them to any new users. You've been warned.","I would have to say that Blockfolio is the worst. For 3 months I've tried too get help with my account and the error codes on my account and still haven't received any help. I've tried to withdraw both cryptocurrency and USD coins and it will not let me. I've reached out to support on that as well and again, NO HELP.

I like that I can pass the time and generate passive income. I haven't tried to withdraw yet, but only because it says you can earn 5% if you have over 35k in coin. Sounds good to me. I will only change this rating if it for some reason doesn't allow me to withdraw my earned btc. Anyway, enjoying the app and happy to make some dough. Thanks Cointiply!","At first it was very good. Playtime was brilliant. I hardly change the device because the other one had a problem. This was said on both devices at once: this is not compatible with my device. 5 minutes before there were no problems. Even after I reset the cache and the GAID, it is not possible the support just says that my phone is not compatible. 5 minutes before everything works, you are simply fobbed off, and that after 4-5 days until you get an answer in support gets a shame. And i see it coming an standard answer here who says plz reset the GAID and Cache -.- or plz contact our support (that what i have done before i make the review.","This is one of the better sites to make a few dollars. They pay very well (relatively) to play their app games. I admit the games are just boring luck based ones, but still, they pay pretty well. The hourly roll for free coin is more data intensive than other apps and the capcha is a bit of a pain, but it's free. I also like the idea that they pay interest if you have 35k coin balance. I've made about $10 in coin in two weeks.","Great site, I just wish the surveys were more available to get. *edit: Thanks for the response :D another great reason to like this site!. I was just getting a lot of sad face emojis & \"this survey isn't for you\" Everything else seems so well balanced and even entertaining, keep up the great work!","This WAS a great app until the survey issues (see previous review) but hey, the games were working great until about 10 minutes ago when I took a break and now can't play them anymore due to \"device not supported\". Are you kidding me?? I was literally JUST playing without any issues!!! Fix this problem ASAP so I can get back to earning!! My phone has been checked thoroughly and there is no problem on my end...Cointiply is either throttling or has some compatibility issues on their end."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.cointiply.earn.bitcoin","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cointiply.earn.bitcoin&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Merge Cats - Earn Crypto Reward","description":"Get cryptocurrencies by playing in epic crypto game!

It's been having this problem for a while. If this gets fixed and the game/crypto plan on continuing development, then ill def. give 5 stars. I bought in game items too.","Is a decent game to distract yourself for a little while but to be honest it is basically a pay to play scheme where the only people that win are the developers. After one of the latest updates, the token system gives you smaller amounts if any through the daily free capsule. As for the other capsules, they're only for people that deposit real money because if the cost of them. They used to be affordable in game but not anymore.

Or register/sign up attempt is more like it. I received an error each attempt. The verification email link failed and I was told to try again. 3 more attempts still without verified email. My logic: they cannot even process a simple registration with the app so how safe will my assets be with them? I really did want to give it a chance, however I just do not enjoy throwing money away. Uninstalled!","I made my account and transferred in my coins. My advanced verification was pending and then I got an email saying that my account was going to be terminated with no specific reason why. Reaching out to support only got me the same vague reply that they had a reason to close my account but not what reason. Luckily, I was able to remove my coins but I can't ever use Nexo again.","So far it's good. Interest rates are quite competitive and having a lot of options is nice: earn in kind/Nexo, hold Nexo loyalty levels, and a higher locked monthly rate. Have not withdrew yet but reviews say it should be ok, faster than Blockfi at least (but KYC is required for reasonable amounts). Daily compounded interest vs weekly/monthly. App is ok. Text is not clear/scaling issues. GUI is confusing as you're not sure what can be tapped (almost everything can be). Web app is good though.","Worthless app Really cloud flare recaptcha inside the app!? How a company with so much money isn't able to deliver a ok user experience?! Beside user experience I tried at least 10 times to pass basic verification but it just doesn't work. And don't bother fixing this useless app already moved on to another one.","Great platform.

Unfortunately it did not work at all. Of course, the internet of the mobile was also good and there was no excuse The application did not ask me for any information. Just wanted the pool name, which was \"supportxmr\". And then transferred to the ID creation section. After introducing the username and email and giving the password twice, the system thought a little and then gave the above message.","It was working great but since subscribing I now cannot get whatomine to work at all and some of the pools are very difficult to set up as there are no instructions and some have no API key available.

The app is atrocious for shopping/browsing stores through the app. Can't get logged into some stores, can't navigate on others. Back button will have you starting over, etc.","It's a good concept, but the past few times I've played games to get rewards, the reward disappears before I'm able to complete it. It'll say in the rules \"within 20 days of installing\" and I'll go check on the status within 7, and the reward info isn't even available. This has happened to me twice. It doesn't even store it in my history. I'm frustrated.","Ordered some things on Aliexpress. At first, I thought it didn't work, but in a week or so the points showed up for my purchases. Good app, good concept. Can be improved, of course but going in the right direction.","Pretty cool to earn crypto rewards for shopping and playing games on ur phone! When I had an issue receiving a reward, customer service was responsive and resolved the issue quickly. Excites for the debit card launch!!!","So far it works for me as advertised, I find the browser extension easier to shop with but the phone app is nice for quick things.

Though this is probably the vendors fault rather than the devs. But frequently I get ads lasting 30 seconds, you're forced to open google play then you have to go back to the game and wait another 5 seconds. It could be classed as malware as the ads open an app without consent. May want to look into it with the vendor.","My tickets never get included in the prize draws. I keep collecting thousands of them and they never get spent. It's really frustrating seeing that timer always go down, but my tickets are unaffected. Pretty good game appart from that.

The exchange and withdrawal fees are outrageous. You will get better returns on your PC if you invest same amount.","Wasted my money on this one, when you take into consideration the electrical fee, and the withdraw fee, it would take over 100 days of mining to withdraw 0 dollars, and without the withdraw fee, it already takes over a year to recoup the money it takes to get the rate.

Cold wallet staking provide full reward, through mycointainer you get reduced reward and on top of that you get hit with a reward fees. Eg. Cosmos self staking you get 9-10%, mycointainer 8.1% minus 0.41% reward fees. Even though provide easy staking services but dig deep into your rewards.","I started using My Container in June 2020 and I have deposited a bunch of coins on there, also subscribed to the POWER subscription. At first it did run smooth but now I do not get coins every month for the extra subscription. There are some things that I do not agree with, one is that the POWER subscription just got raised without any notice, the second one is that there is a minimum withdrawal for coins and the third is that one does not get rewards for the coins he gets on the subscription. The phone app is a bit shady and has some glitches once in a while like not showing exact amounts, or mistaking the amounts received with euro currency. My humble opinion is that it is a service that can be improved. I would like to see more details on the coins and earnings, 8 decimals as they should be. I would like to not have a minimum withdrawal and maybe get rewards for the rewarded coins one gets. Besides these things that some wouldn't consider minor, the service is a decent staking and masternode service. I do enjoy the giveaways that they have once in a while. Thank you","The app isn't too bad. It lacks all the features you'll find on the website, but it keeps up. This app is pretty much unlike most others in terms of crypto currencies. They offer you airdrops left and right and all sorts of ways to earn. There are some downsides. My KYC verification took about 20 tries. I'm not sure why, but it did eventually go through. If you are looking for an app that will reward you for staking crypto this one will do it. Just be alert that you'll need to stake ~$100 worth of whatever it is you are staking, or you won't be able to withdraw it until it hits that level. The APR earnings are just ridiculously high so it's definitely worth investing some time and effort into. I'll be using them for a a while.","Unexpectedly robust app! Walked through the app for to login and check the mobile UI. Perfect and Very tidy!

Bad move for a young company. Still trying to get the app to work. Will try to remember to update once I have an update to post.","Beware!! App works and the MasterCard works great. There is an undocumented \"miners fee.\" For a $50 Bitcoin to card transfer there was $3.35 Bitcoin fee and a $25 \"miners fee,\" beware!!","Absolutely horrible. They charge fees to load your account and fees to use your card. Out of an initial $50 usd I deposited to set the account up and get my card, there was $12 left. And when you go to withdraw that $12 of btc, the transaction fee is higher than the amount you want to withdraw. Add $100 cash, and you only receive $86","Experience sucked and is Continue to suck. Sent me a card I loaded it from XRP I moved to bitpay and used it.Had 18.54 and 311 XRP still available.Card can no longer be loaded and MasterCard services says they no longer support the Bitpay card and cannot help and of course they are not responding to email. Moving the XRP has proven to be difficult. It may be an issue with all 5 methods I tried by transfer, exchange, or loading card, but probably just Bitpay.

No sms received yet its the same number registered with. Email link also doesn't work. Issues like this makes one wonder of the viability of this app completely...","They have been stealing money for years now.. People ignore the bad reviews.. they trust this app by finding few positive reviews. For every new person that downloads this app.. it will work flawlessy for couple of months.. then it starts.. Pending deposits.. support team is just writing nonsense.. just buying time.. most people believe them and wait for them to return coins or €.. BE AWARE!!! IT WILL WORK FOR FEW MONTHS (MAYBE LESS)..

And why we have 2 apps, normal and pro. Just integrate both in one app and user should be able to choose the normal or pro layout just like other exchange. To be fair, sell/buy/withdrawal was a breeze experience though.","Clean User interface and very friendly experience 🎉 Makes investing as simple as it should be. Half a year later, I feel a need to update this review but unfortunately I can't give more than 5 stars. In the beginning I screwed up two times with my fiat fundings. I thought I lost that money, but when I reached out to Kraken support they fixed it in less than two days. Very friendly and patient employees 💎✨👑","One thing I really miss is a little indicator next to my coins that shows the change in their value as a percentage compared to my initial investment (ex. +3,6% compared to when I bought the coin). Honestly, I don't understand how is this not a feature already, literally every other crypto and stock exchange has this. Otherwise it's great so far.","I'm genuinely shocked at how basic this app is. It's meant to be one of the most established exchanges, but the functionality of this app is way behind any others I've used. There's no ability to search, and cryptos aren't listed alphabetically, so it's difficult to find anything. No price alerts either. I can only assume a browser based version is far better.","This app requires me to remove and register my bank constantly. Advice from support was to just keep reconnecting it. But I am limited to 5 bank connects within a 30 day period. Great advice... 😑. Something todo with a timeout from my bank. Well, yeah you don't keep the connection open unless you are buying. If it's trustly's error then switch to plaid Gemini works just fine, no issues whats so ever. If Gemini added Cardano to their platform. I'll would just remove my Kraken account."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.kraken.invest.app","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kraken.invest.app&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Ecos DeFi Platform","description":"Mining and Cloud Mining are the main ways to get Bitcoin and other leading cryptocurrencies.

Big possibilities. But as it stands this app is pretty broken. A lot of things just plain don't work and a lot of functionality that you would expect is strangely missing. For example - there seems to be no way to actually search for a particular stream. You just get a small selection of \"recommended\" streams. The search function never brings anything up.","That's sign up process is not intuitive at all. If I weren't a developer I wouldn't know what was going on. The page where you set the username doesn't even have labels for the text boxes. And videos restart when you change the orientation of your phone?","This is actually really good what you have to remember is this is in its early stages but the potential and concept is massive (desk top version is definitely more polished) . I recommend checking out their Web page to see what they are all about and getting behind them.","I'm giving a low rating here with hopes to find a way to ask customer support why, if I have the Samsung galaxy 20, do I have so many issues with this app. After watching 8+ hours of different streams and videos. I've subscribed to channels, type hello, and other actions to earn Tfuel, but still have zero. None of the rewards I received exist anymore. I've never been able to access my profile. These issues occur using my unlimited data plan or WiFi at home. Can't find customer service on the app","I love the concept of Theta.tv but extremely disappointed in the application. I have on several occasions watched hours of Theta.tv sponsored streams(Nasa) supposedly allowing users to earn Theta fuel , this didn't happen no rewards but xp. Also when you \"are\"sharing your band width and the phone rotates it completely resets your sharing poor poor poor. I can only hope they get these things figured out or mass adoption will suffer.

Also, the app is too buggy, and still is after the update, after every other action it either stays on loading infinitely or it just goes into a black screen and I have to exit and reopen it, I updated hoping it would get fixed, since it promised bug fixes and improvements, but the only thing I see the update did is now require to bind a phone number to one's account to be able to continue using it, and now withdraws are disabled?!","Can't access the game again. I used the code that was sent to my phone within the specified 60 seconds for phone verification only to be told that my session has expired. I did it the second time, it was same story.

Major problem is the lag which often ends in crashes. Everytime it does that, all the scores and GWEI went with it, leaving you back on level 1. Crashes are very common when you're doing great with your game. It's like it does not favor that you win and make great points. As to the ETH you can earn, it's too minute and almost neglible to even think playing this game for years can change your life in the long run.","Amazing game ! I find myself sitting down for a quick 5-10 game and an hour later I'm still playing. It really does pay out, instantly ! EDIT : 07-25-21 The game used to be 5 stars, now it's a weak 3 star game. Adds have increased 100%. I just scored 32000+ and for that effort, I was given 675 gwei ?!! A score like that should have paid out 4x that amount. Come on team, don't get cheap on us, the price of Ethereum is down. The payout SHOULD GO UP !!!!!!","Does what it says it does. Great mindless game for meetings or when watching TV. If you're going to mess around on Candy Crush, why not get paid for it? I've made some decent cash off of this and it's funding my smaller crypto investments. Yeah, there's ads. You get used to them, especially once you know how long they last. Just put the tv on and look up when an ad comes on. Great app, wish there were more like it.","Pays out easily and quickly with coinbase. 5 stars. The game is fun. BUT!!! constantly glitches and you have to start over. I was just on a roll, my best game. Start of level 6, a flash, and im back at level 1, and my coins are gone! You still get credit for ETH. But its totally deflating, and makes people stop playing. IF THE GAME STOPPED CRASHING ID GIVE 5 STARS AND PLAY MORE. VERY DISAPPOINTED","Sure enough, it pays out Ethereum almost instantly. It's kind of hard to get figured out, though. You need to go into where it says redeem in order to get it sent to your wallet. Doesn't add up fast at all, but it's an all right time waster. And tons of ads, but that should be a given for anyone looking at this kind of thing. I'd love to see a cleaner interface and more information about how much is paid out per point, but that's easy enough to figure out."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.mansoon.cryptopop","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mansoon.cryptopop&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Coini — Bitcoin / Cryptocurrencies","description":"You are interested in the magic internet money or even own some yourself?

I have already submitted a request for refund with the feedback link. Would appreciate a reply with an email and refund of the amount paid. It's a total scam.

Had it been I've been notified that workers ID can only be gotten on computer I wouldn't have given myself d stress of subscribing.Getting worker ID gave me problem bcos d app can only work on window12. I will b glad if d admin can work on d aspect of making cryptotabfarm app function on android bcos dat is d only way d app can be promoted.

Preferably, develop the app to mine on Android, IOS and windows. I have check the demo and I am impressed but after I subscribe for 5 slots and followed the instructions, it is all a mess.

I also wish I had the option to mine all 3 options at once even if this where an upgrade only feature. The name multi-mine lead me to believe I would have this ability, which is what drew me to the app originally. Def recommend!","So far I like the app. I upgraded to gold and it moves much faster!The speed is fine. Few things to read. You have to get verified and it can take up to 10 days however it stated you can request to send it through the platform to speed it up. Within that timline you'd have to wait to cash out which can take up to 5 business days. I read how to avoid losing Satoshi bc it is how the user manipulate the app opposite of what the developers recommendation bc support helped me with the issue.","Great mining App, I've mined before, weeks on end, month after month, after 90 days I couldn't even visit the dollar store. This app is legit, you spend 20 1ce and easily make 80, I always forget about my phone and app stuff. I like doing real things, hardly turning it on I make a 400% profit. Il invest the total $120 next time I bet It would make new car payments for me","Lost BCH, around 17,000. Will update if fixed. Update, still not fixed and now missing even more from the btc tab. Will update if fixed. Email many times, messaged from the dashboard on website and put in multiple requests for missing Satoshi and not fixed. They keep taking the Satoshi that their customers accumulate on their app. You build up 10,000 plus sat on any or multiple tabs on the app one day it's gone. And they do not respond except to send you an email to update your wallet info. Scam","So. It's nice seeing numbers run at the toppa ya screen, but I been waiting for my “pending” request to be completed for about 14 days now. It's getting annoying. Also, if you think you can mine, while your phone is on standby, and by that I don't even mean closing the app, but just pushing the power button so the screen turns dark (but the phone's still on), you are terribly wrong!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.task.multimine","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.task.multimine&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Coin Dozer: Sweepstakes","description":"Join the millions of people playing Coin Dozer, the original coin pusher game!

I have 52 coins put 3 coins down 5 times it tells me I'm out of coins I'm not sure if or how much more I'm going to play!! Not worth the aggregation. Well waited over 2 weeks for a reply but it just seems like they only care about the money they get for the ads!! Well that's not for me I'm Uninstalling now. Hope you have better luck then me!!","The old Coin Dozer was a lot better. No annoying, useless apps, offers, other bs that wastes your time, etc. And the countdown until a new coin is added only goes down when you're in the app. If you exit the app to use another, the countdown stops and adds a few seconds. I don't know if it's just me, but it did happen. Bring back the old Coin Dozer, because that Coin Dozer was worth the storage space and time. This one isn't at all. Really disappointing.","Half the time you spend in the app will be on adds if you want to progress anywhere, 70% of which will be for missplay. The bonus you get from the walls can be nullified by a random add you can't skip for 5 seconds (which is how long the bonus lasts) do that's a pain. Also the game itself isn't that entertaining so the my previous points are amplified. Only reason I downloaded the app was for a bonus in my other game, I'll be uninstalling this app as soon as I get those bonuses. Unfortunate.","Game has improved with the removal of the 'Balloon Pop' feature. I like the sweepstake feature, I have won $10 on it, so far! Edit: After the latest update my coin regen limit of 72 has dropped to 52 for an unknown reason. I have twice reached out to game support, with no response. Currently at level 223.","As a game, not bad. But as a giveaway service, maybe make the sweepstakes drawing a bit faster if possible, and reduce the clutter on the screen. Usually, simpler apps get more attention."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.leftover.CoinDozer","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.leftover.CoinDozer&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Signals - Crypto","description":"Signals - Crypto is a service provided by some experienced persons from cryptocurrencies market.\r\n\r\nWe receive signal advices from: Ca Kiem Group, CryptoFamily, Trading Crypto Vietnam....\r\n\r\nWe learn strong TA/FA from Trading 4 Bitcoin and some VIP groups.\r\n\r\nSimilar to the stock market, cryptocurrencies’ values fluctuate either upwards or downwards; hence if you do not what to purchase, when to purchase it, and what to put on sale; you’re just guessing.\r\n\r\nSignal - Crypto will serve to notify you on the best moment to buy  alts and btc for the maximum profit.

It shows profit based on peak price reached when the actual profit would be according to the profit targets give by your own app. This is misleading people, atleast a range of min and max profit should be shown. Edit: Developer says this will be added in next updates so I increased my rating!","Hi, Edited my review because all the previous issues are solved, also upping to 4 star :) The remaining issues though: - most times I have to click on a signal 4-5 times when the targets open down, somehow the UI is glitchy - the other huge issue as I see it is the need of using 1.1.1.1 app otherwise the prices and notifications don't update, thats very bad because with that App on, Binance doesnt work correctly for example, also other apps dont like it, it makes for a bad experience overall.","Terrible app. 15 out of 15 trades lost. Better odds just picking a coin because you like the name, then flipping a coin to decide on long or short. To make things even better for any potential users it says 3 days free trial. I cancelled on the 3rd day 6am and said it will cancel end of day. Meaning you will get charged for the month you dnt want","The best app for signals. Every internet app has delayed push notifications, so not a unique problem. Besides you still have plenty of time to join most trades(except scalp). Nice personal touch too, with the constant 'only go in 10%', 'take profit' warnings haha","Great job on the recent updates . The app is alot smoother now . Don't listen to the bad reviews that are looking for spoon fed trades and complaining when no trades are posted . This guy goes out of his way to warn people about market volatility and when to stay in cash . He waits for the market instead of chasing it. Apparently this is something a lot of the people commenting here still need to learn. Don't let the bad reviews from the clueless drones discourage you.

This one pays out and is fun to play. For kids this is a good vocabulary builder. For adults this keeps the mind sharp. For a bonus you get to cash out Satoshi. So far I have been paid out 3 times, though it sometimes requires multiple attempts to submit the payout request. Also the limit seems to be 200 Satoshi before it stops accruing, perhaps that limit will be lifted after this review. Payout can be made every 72 hours. Hopefully the payout limit is lifted. Will update if so. B+","I reached the max of 200 satoshi before you have to cash out to earn more. I went to claim and had to do a reCAPTCHA which is not a problem. The problem is when i did it and selected all the correct boxes it said i was blocked. I am not a robot. With every other thing I've had to do a reCAPTCHA with, if it thinks you've made a mistake it gives you another chance. This app does not. I ended up uninstalling and reinstalling to try to make it work. It caused me to lose all the satoshi I earned.","Good game to play as you relax to go to sleep. However, very disappointed that you can only collect 200 now. It use to be 2000. When I first started playing this game it was 1000. Got excited that it was raised to 2000, but a year late it get dropped by 90%. Big bummer.","Have cashed out successfully in the past but now getting \"invalid data -3\" error. The cap was also lowered and previously it gave out BCH when BTC was promised. Other apps by this dev still working well for me.","App really pay out your win. The game is fun and you can get a small amount of BTC just for have fun to play. The payment go straight to your wallet, fast and easy.

The PAMP token contract rewards holders when the price increases and penalizes sellers when it does not. \r\n\r\nOur new Web3 friendly encrypted mobile wallet is live on Mainnet with thousands of investors in the PAMP community. We make yield farming in DeFi super simple. Keep track of your PAMP balances, claim your staking rewards, check daily price action, plus so much more. Download for free today!\r\n\r\nHere’s a little taste of what our app does:\r\n\r\nHOLD PAMP TOKENS\r\nStore, send and receive your PAMP by importing an existing wallet or creating a new one.\r\n\r\nCLAIM YOUR STAKES\r\nSee how much time is left, the next expected reward and claim your staking rewards.\r\n\r\nGROW YOUR STACK\r\nHODL and claim your stakes every positive day, and see your portfolio appreciate over time.\r\n\r\nOPTIMIZE SETTINGS\r\nIncrease your gas fee to speed up your transaction when sending tokens across the Ethereum blockchain. \r\n\r\nHOW IT WORKS\r\n\r\nWhen the token price appreciates, token holders receive staking rewards based on several factors including the percentage price increase, how long they have been holding for and how many tokens they hold. Rewards are distributed on a daily basis!\r\n\r\nIf the token price does not appreciate, no rewards are minted. Sellers who move their tokens around have their stakes reset, negating any bonus rewards they may receive when the token appreciates in value. \r\n\r\nIn addition, PAMP is deflationary, meaning that all token transfers have 8% of the transfer or sell burned. On negative days, this increases by 2% per day until the price is positive again. Holders are strongly incentivized to buy tokens and HODL as long as possible.\r\n\r\nFAQs\r\n\r\nHow do I claim my rewards?\r\nEvery day the price change is positive, simply navigate to the home screen of our mobile app or visit pamp.network/staking to claim your rewards. If you move or sell tokens, you will pay a fee of 8% and your staking time will reset, which will significantly decrease your rewards. If you receive 10% of your tokens (by purchasing them or otherwise having them transferred to you), your staking time will decrease by 1 day.\r\n\r\nWhat is the minimum staking amount?\r\nThe minimum amount to receive price-reactive staking rewards is 200 PAMP. For Uniswap liquidity staking, there is no minimum to stake and receive rewards.\r\n\r\nWho governs the Oracle?\r\nThe PAMP Network uses a backend service that queries Uniswap for pricing data three times a day and then updates the smart contract on Ethereum with the average percentage change. We are working on upgrading this service to query for the price once every hour. In the future we will use the Chainlink Oracle for decentralized price updates.\r\n\r\nWhat is Holder’s Day?\r\nOnce a month, usually at the end of the month, we activate Holder’s Day, which is a day that all holders of 30 days or more (as of this day) can get a nice bump in their rewards, regardless of price action. The current holder’s day reward formula is: tokens received = balance * (days staked / 600). \r\n\r\nHas the contract been audited?\r\nYes, we have successfully completed two security audits of our smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. You can view the detailed reports on our website.\r\n\r\nCOMING SOON\r\n\r\nOur mission is to become the best mobile wallet for staking in DeFi, so we also plan to add:\r\n\r\nTrading via Uniswap\r\nLiquidity staking\r\nFiat onboarding ramps (no need to leave the app)\r\n\r\nNEED MORE HELP?\r\nVisit our website for more information or contact our community support on social media:\r\n\r\nWebsite - Pamp.Network\r\nTwitter - @PampNetwork\r\nTelegram - t.me/PampNetwork\r\nMedium - @PampNetwork\r\nGithub - Pamp-Network\r\n\r\n\r\nPrivacy Policy: https://pamp.network/privacy.pdf","descriptionHTML":"Pamp Network is the first price-reactive decentralized finance project built on the Ethereum blockchain.
