I would probably have given 5 stars if were to show real time through put data for the network and attached devices. There is a place to show upload and download for devices but it doesn't really work. Overall, good app though.","Says I'm connected, but no internet? Wants me to use go to a website through the app while connected to the device that's not connected to the internet so it defeats the purpose of its use. Won't give me internet, won't work unless I'm connected to the device that has no internet. Is there a no star option? Cause you idiots definitely need it.","So far so good! Well not sure when that was from but the statement held true until today. An update from June was installed. Since then I cannot access the cloud based administrator via the mobile app and I can no longer access the web based admin page either. The only solution I have been able to locate thus far requires performing a factory reset which I prefer not to do if at all possible.","Works well with current capability Definite benefit would be for push alerts via app or email when a router has gone offline. Also, a very helpful change would be for any offline routers in the app to be shown in red or highlighted. Just changing the text to grey to say offline isn't easy to spot I'd you are scrolling through a list of routers.","Very nice but it would be great to have the option to save the number of devices by typing the number of devices that I will keep running. Other devices will never connect without saving. And it would be very good to have the option to add new devices.

It's great otherwise.. or make it use the same name/password reconnect.","Finally, a tethering solution that works on Linux! I've been looking for one of these for years! Thank you so much PanJava! Just so you know, Linux's Network Manager also has a SSTP Plugin now, so it is easier to set up that way than it is through pppd.","Works as specified. When Hello Mobile switched to the new TMobile SIM cards, the network began blocking use of \"dun\" in the APN settings, which prevents devices connected to the hotspot from receiving data. Testing on the connected secondary devices, a ping to any site resolves DNS and sends the initial outgoing packet, but all incoming packets after that are blocked by the network. This app resolves that issue.","Great app. Been able to use my phone with my laptop and get good speeds. I have even did some light gaming. A must if your in need of extra data for a laptop on the go.","Great and works properly, but says free in the name then hits you with a 1 mbps speed cap (which is basically unusable id be fine if it was like 5 mbps smh) and says your trial has expired and wants you to pay money. very uncool, please be more straightforward with your app description.

Windows side also need updating from http://pdanet.co/install\r\n2. Original WiFi Hotspot feature remains in the separate FoxFi app if you still need it, just install from Play Store. You can also find previous (4.19) version of PdaNet+ at http://pdanet.co/install/old\r\n3.

We try our best to offer the \"most convenient solution possible\" for sharing phone Internet but it may not be an \"ideal\" or \"universal\" solution (e.g. a normal WiFi Hotspot). It may not work for particular devices. \r\n\r\n=====WiFi Direct mode (new!) ====\r\nPdaNet+ now comes with a completely new \"WiFi Direct Hotspot\" feature that works on all Android phones 4.1 or later. It allows you to connect computers and tablets to your phone using WiFi BUT it will require you to either install our client app or setup proxy depending on what device you are connecting to the phone. You can activate \"WiFi Direct Hotspot\" in PdaNet+ then tap the \"Help!\" button for detail instructions. \r\n\r\n*If your Windows computer does not see the hotspot during pairing please do two things: 1. Restart Hotspot on the phone. \r\n2. Click on \"Show All WiFi Direct Hotspot\". It will verify if your adapter supports 5Ghz.\r\n\r\n====FoxFi/WiFi Hotspot Mode (the old) ====\r\nThe original WiFi Hotspot feature remains in the separate FoxFi app if you still need it. It has ceased to function on many newer phone models due to carrier updates.  Even when it works, your hotspot usage may still be metered (see plan 2 below). WiFi Direct Hotspot could solve both issues. However the new feature is not meant to support game devices, TVs or TV streaming devices. \r\n\r\n=====USB Mode=====\r\nUSB mode works on all Android phones (except for some ZTE/Alcatel models). It allows connection from Windows or Mac. In addition, there is a \"WiFi Share\" feature that can further turn Windows into a WiFi Hotspot so that you share PdaNet Internet with other devices.\r\n\r\n*If your phone is not recognized by your computer after connecting USB, please see http://pdanet.co/driver\r\n\r\n=====Bluetooth Mode=====\r\nYou can use Bluetooth mode to connect Windows.  Although WiFi Direct mode is preferred.\r\n\r\n=====Do I need this software?=====\r\nThe PdaNet software has been around since the first Treo smart phone in 2003. With over 30 million downloads in total, it must be something that everyone needs, right? Well...it really depends on the kind of data plan you have for your phone. There are 4 kinds of data plans from most carriers:\r\n\r\n1. Your data plan (limited or unlimited) does not allow you to turn on the mobile hotspot feature on the phone (it prompts you to call your carrier). \r\n\r\n2. Your data plan is unlimited and you can turn on mobile hotspot from your phone to use it. But hotspot usage is \"metered\" against a cap (say 5G/month). After that the speed will be throttled to a crawl. (FoxFi can't avoid this!)\r\n\r\n3. Your data plan is unlimited, and you can turn on mobile hotspot from your phone with unlimited LTE usage and no throttling cap. This plan does NOT exist or not intended. But we have seen loopholes on some phone models to allow it.\r\n\r\n4. You data plan is limited and it allows you to turn on mobile hotspot from your phone. The mobile hotspot usage goes under the same data plan limit.\r\n\r\nIf your plan falls under 1 or 2, you will need to use PdaNet+. If your plan belongs to 3 or 4 then PdaNet+ will not make any difference. If you are unsure what plan you have, it won't harm to always use PdaNet+. \r\n\r\n=======================\r\nFree edition of PdaNet+ will have timed usage limit, otherwise it is same as full version.\r\n\r\nSprint and AT&T may not allow you to install our app from Play Store, please install the apk file directly from http://pdanet.co/install or install from the computer side.","descriptionHTML":"Version 5.10 has major changes, MUST read below before updating. <br><br>1.

It will verify if your adapter supports 5Ghz.<br><br>====FoxFi/WiFi Hotspot Mode (the old) ====<br>The original WiFi Hotspot feature remains in the separate FoxFi app if you still need it. It has ceased to function on many newer phone models due to carrier updates.  Even when it works, your hotspot usage may still be metered (see plan 2 below). WiFi Direct Hotspot could solve both issues. However the new feature is not meant to support game devices, TVs or TV streaming devices. <br><br>=====USB Mode=====<br>USB mode works on all Android phones (except for some ZTE/Alcatel models). It allows connection from Windows or Mac. In addition, there is a &quot;WiFi Share&quot; feature that can further turn Windows into a WiFi Hotspot so that you share PdaNet Internet with other devices.<br><br>*If your phone is not recognized by your computer after connecting USB, please see http://pdanet.co/driver<br><br>=====Bluetooth Mode=====<br>You can use Bluetooth mode to connect Windows.  Although WiFi Direct mode is preferred.<br><br>=====Do I need this software?=====<br>The PdaNet software has been around since the first Treo smart phone in 2003. With over 30 million downloads in total, it must be something that everyone needs, right? Well...it really depends on the kind of data plan you have for your phone. There are 4 kinds of data plans from most carriers:<br><br>1. Your data plan (limited or unlimited) does not allow you to turn on the mobile hotspot feature on the phone (it prompts you to call your carrier). <br><br>2. Your data plan is unlimited and you can turn on mobile hotspot from your phone to use it. But hotspot usage is &quot;metered&quot; against a cap (say 5G/month). After that the speed will be throttled to a crawl. (FoxFi can&#39;t avoid this!)<br><br>3. Your data plan is unlimited, and you can turn on mobile hotspot from your phone with unlimited LTE usage and no throttling cap. This plan does NOT exist or not intended. But we have seen loopholes on some phone models to allow it.<br><br>4. You data plan is limited and it allows you to turn on mobile hotspot from your phone. The mobile hotspot usage goes under the same data plan limit.<br><br>If your plan falls under 1 or 2, you will need to use PdaNet+. If your plan belongs to 3 or 4 then PdaNet+ will not make any difference. If you are unsure what plan you have, it won&#39;t harm to always use PdaNet+. <br><br>=======================<br>Free edition of PdaNet+ will have timed usage limit, otherwise it is same as full version.<br><br>Sprint and AT&amp;T may not allow you to install our app from Play Store, please install the apk file directly from http://pdanet.co/install or install from the computer side.","summary":"Share smart phone Internet with computers or tablets, no rooting needed.","installs":"10,000,000+","minInstalls":10000000,"maxInstalls":10335825,"score":4.1366134,"scoreText":"4.1","ratings":81272,"reviews":25885,"histogram":{"1":10358,"2":3095,"3":5179,"4":9088,"5":53549},"price":0,"free":true,"currency":"USD","priceText":"Free","offersIAP":false,"size":"283k","androidVersion":"4.1","androidVersionText":"4.1 and up","developer":"June Fabrics Technology Inc.","developerId":"June+Fabrics+Technology+Inc.","developerEmail":"support@junefabrics.com","developerWebsite":"http://pdanet.co","developerAddress":"11325 Random Hills Road\nFairfax, VA 22030","developerInternalID":"6182907446639660305","genre":"Communication","genreId":"COMMUNICATION","icon":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/n6rn3713YcXohcRbX77HxFVrT7RUOsTamLVy6fSf8Y-s3uMLTq-ra37LlTtqdzQ0YX1Y","headerImage":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/wmbXzj2xfchjfE2Jngk3Hmp7ttcNNDIqgc7zp70GznLmPx_Aif3AinyOfijbQ2622g","screenshots":["https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/1SlJ4TI1mUfqojz21g5i6gaW4MQJGkM9aAUaFjGJa3dgbrplNsyhrqvsygiA2r0LnBdu","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/uhnpztAVIA0qu05uq-609HL7s3jT6yf1SDxmbWP8MdM5DJKx5IK1tSPP2SbPBn1TW96S","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/IEmzNtnWM2iMb1ND6IwOHgfX6rTFPeAePr7H8gzpvQcEspgNFVFI_7aVyHWRmPYfiA","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/t3lZ5Howb_enHgzls_K8zNFSiijhUdqt0DzTmTJk5NYoxk6dU2Cydwu8dsjrL7vA"],"contentRating":"Everyone","adSupported":false,"updated":1608656674000,"version":"5.23","recentChanges":"Fix wifi direct detection issue when connecting from tablet or mac.

Its a Hassel because then I have to go back to the App and turn it on again. When you have the full version unlocked it's not supposed to turn off like that. Thats why you buy the unlock key App is always on. Please fix this issue so it works like its supposed to and I'll give you a 5 star rating. it's a GREAT APP when it stays on the time.","Had been using free version on tablet and started having to enter password and long connection times. I bought paid version hoping to get better service and avoid password entry but no such luck. Contacted developer with no response. This used to be a great app and not so much now. Just wasted 8 bucks again. App is working great as of 2021 so far, upgraded rating.","It took me a while to figure out how to get the Wifi direct connected to my Mac. It would connect for five seconds, and then disconnect. Neither Chrome nor Safari worked. I figured out that you have to enable IPv6 instead of IPv4 on the android side, then connect the Mac to the hotspot through PdaNet, not through Wifi. Also, make sure you enable auto proxies and type in the correct address as described on PdaNet's help website. After these steps, I was getting 50+ Mbps on TMobile.","I can't believe I can only give this app 5 stars. It is incredibly easy to use, and the connection is about as reliable as just using my hotspot. Occasionally it needs to be restarted (maybe once every 4th or 5th time I would connect) which is fine for streaming and general ween surfing, and the WiFi connection is fast and only uses my phone's data (not hotspot data)."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.pdanet","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pdanet&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"SecureTether - Free no root Bluetooth tethering","description":"FAST, FREE ¹, SECURE TETHERING OVER BLUETOOTH:\r\n(SHARE INTERNET CONNECTION LIKE A MOBILE HOTSPOT)\r\n\r\n✔  Share your mobile internet connection with your computer or Android tablet\r\n✔  Get internet on your computer or Android tablet anywhere you have cell service\r\n✔  ANY data connection on your phone will work (4G, 3G, LTE, GPRS, WiFi, WiMax, ...)\r\n✔  No need to pay for a tethering plan from your mobile carrier ¹\r\n✔  No need to root your phone or tablet\r\n✔  No need to install any custom software on your computer ²\r\n\r\nPOWERFUL SECURITY AND TETHERING MANAGEMENT FEATURES:\r\n\r\n✔  Built-in strong firewall helps protect your computer from hackers\r\n✔  Avoid the risks of using a WiFi hotspot (no need to worry about recent WiFi hacks)\r\n✔  Monitor all incoming and outgoing internet connections to detect spy-ware\r\n✔  Block websites, for example to prevent Windows updates on a limited data plan\r\n\r\nEASY TO USE:\r\n\r\n✔  Detailed setup instructions with screenshots for Windows, Mac OS X, Android\r\n✔  Connect with a single double-click (or two taps) after initial setup is complete\r\n✔  Manage and monitor connections directly from browser on computer or tablet\r\n✔  Extremely low idle power use, so app can be ready to connect 24/7\r\n✔  No need to touch phone at all to connect if within Bluetooth range (same room)\r\n\r\nMAXIMUM PERFORMANCE:\r\n\r\n✔  Delivers full performance that Bluetooth and cell service can provide\r\n✔  Includes DNS cache to speed up website loading and reduce data use\r\n\r\nMAXIMUM COMPATIBILITY:\r\n\r\n✔  Share mobile internet connection from any Android 2.1+ device ...\r\n✔  ... with Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, 8.1, 10, ...\r\n✔  ...

I wish there is a much faster way of determining which deco unit my phone is connected to. Sometimes even when I am in the bedroom ive seen my phone remaining connected to the main study located unit. And lastly it is also not simple to speed test where you are without going to a separate app. The best thing I can compliment the system is the ease of installation and the accompanying phone application. Simply- very simple and easy to follow.","Product is good, App / Control is Lacking. Can Not do some Basic things. You can not sort devices attached to mesh by data used. I can not find a history of data usage by device. I can not find daily, weekly, monthly data usage. Current data usage has a very slow refresh (4k tv shows 10kbs on Disney+) not possible.","I used this app to connect 3 x Deco X20. Straight forward to set up and adding extra Decos are a breeze. Good UI and enough information to know what's going on in your network. The \"notify if new device connected\" is really nice. 2 things that bug me: 1) would be nice to have default parental control applied for new device 2) I suddenly can't see any connected device and parental control icon disappeared from the app, turns out I need to reboot the main Deco unit for whatever reason :(","I was skeptical a.d prepared for an Amazon return when I purchased the wifi mesh setup for let than $100 on an Amazon prime day deal but I was pleasantly suprised by the product. Impressive fast setup. Easy to use. Works great. What more could you ask for?!? Easier to set up than smart home outlets and it works as advertised. 10/10 would recommend","Only had it a day but love it!! Had the nighthawk and hated it, had large reservations about a mesh system since I have so many things plugged in with ethernets I didn't think it would be fast enough. Boy was I wrong. Everything is fast as heck. Speeds went from 230ish to 450. I have my main Xbox hardwired and that's faster as well. The install couldn't have been simpler as long as it holds up I couldn't recommend this more.

You have saved me so much money with this little chunk of code that i would have happily paid 3x what you were asking for it years ago when i purchased it. This app finds it's way onto every single android device i've owned. You can bypass your bandwidth cap with this. You can wifi tether on any carrier exactly the way you deserve to. This thing is so versatile too. It has basically every wireless tethering protocol i guess. you can use hostapd which is the linux daemon for ad-hoc networking. I typically stick with this if possible but because different devices are designed with many different chipsets, one method will not suffice for them all. Some carriers have disabled native tethering software also. I do not understand why customers who are paying (often very high rates) for service are not free to do with their bandwidth and access as they please. This is simply a strong-arm business tactic to milk you for bandwidth fees on top of your \"unlimited\" plan. in an ideal world, these companies have no business curating your activities as long as you're not doing anything dangerous or immoral. I pay you for a 4G data connection, give me a 4G data connection and mind your business. Hey devs, you guys let me know if there's ever anything i can help you guys out with because i got your back. I mean that too. You have set me free from the bonds of shady business tactics weilded by unethical companies who are more than just willing to exploit us in each and every single way that they possibly can. You guys rock and I will punch this inept fool who didn't RTFM and projected his incompetence onto you. You dork, you should be ashamed of putting a 1-star review on this powerful piece of software. Quite obvious you have no clue what is going on, you absolute muppet.","Great app. Best wifi hotspot app I've found, & I've tried many! (Of course, it only works on rooted phones.) If you have root & want a portable wifi to take anywhere, this is the app for you. However with my phone provider, Metro PCS, on T-Mobile network, I have to start my VPN first before starting Tether Router.

If you don't pay for the app you can only access http sites which is getting to be very few. You should have an above average knowledge about setting up a network connection and be able to follow instruction to use this app or you will be one of the ones that write a review saying it doesnt work. They give very good instruction on how to get it to work. I think I had to disable one saved network to get it to work once and I either missed that in the instructions or it didn't saying anything about it but that part was just common sense. With the version I bought I have to contact them for a new activation code if I change phones and it usually took a couple days for a reply. This time it has been 5 days and no reply. I hope they didn't abandon giving support to the app because of all the dumbasses that were too stupid to own a computer. (That last sentence was a joke because a friend of mine use to own a computer store and when making repairs to software related issues there were many times when he wanted to tell the customer to take the computer back to where you bought it and tell them you want your money back because you're too stupid to own a computer.)","This app is a lifesaver when my internet provider drops service but cellular service is still up.

Ability to delete indvidual recorded capture from the memory card (available for personally captured items) but not possible with motion detection auto record..only way to format. AWESOME JOB, Thanks","The screen to watch recordings on the camera is garbage - there's just a slider that is not very precise at all, and there's no way to speed up footage.It is far better to put the memory card on a PC and watch the recordings there, which is cumbersome. The rest of the app is okay, but since I use RTSP for streaming the camera, I just need the app to monitor recordings, and it really fails at that. I also couldn't figure out how to Chromecast from this app, I ended up using VLC for that.","Not bad but it really needs a dark theme in 2021 when so many phones have OLED screens now. The white background is a battery killer and looks way too bright at night. Also the camera movement detection push notification is unreliable despite the fact that I've disabled power optimization for the app in Android settings so the process can run in the background at all times.

The app will do as it says, it'll let you go into USB tether mode which is built in to Android, it's a shortcut.\nPros:\n* A little quicker than having to go through menu system. \n* Has home screen widget that displays speed. \n* Works well with PdaNet+ because it uses Androids built in tether system. \nCons:\n* Ad supported with no option to buy without ads, for that reason it's uninstalled (for now) \n* Can't actually activate USB Tether, I'm convinced that with an adb command (and engineering) USB Tether could do this i.e. permit write to system settings \n* Seems to drop off/exit. I'd like the app to stay resident in memory so that when I plug in a computing device again, poof ready to go.","I did a cursory search for \"usb internet sharing\" and saw this near the top.

Oftentimes the camera go offline. Typically one camera will go offline while others stay on. It's random. Playing video back is just non-existent. Not sure if this is how it's supposed to be. It's also selective on what history is available. ➡️Update: Now I can't access the camera's at all. I upgraded the account and hours later I was completely locked out. When logging in I get, \"There is no app available to view this URL.\"","So many great features and options, depending on what you need and how much you want to spend . Very clear, decent storage of clips to save. Our only challenge has been to reset it back up if there is a problem. I recomend saving the box your camera came in, or at least the bar code and product info numbers. Update: Constantly losing connectivity and it's not my internet, about to send it back and switch to Ring, which I have outside and with fewer issues.","I love the ability to answer a doorbell from the phone and to talk with the person from my phone. However, in the free software version, the majority of captured photos do not even show the person who caused an alert. I know it is free, but my Arlo camera's free version stores an online video for a few days and that can be downloaded. I do not want to pay the fee which I think is too high for Nest.","Update: Also, can't view your cam if you don't want Google tracking cookies, as they block you if you block cookies. Try it, you'll see. This is disgusting, anti-consumer behavior and is tantamount to spyware. You finally resolved the constant connection issues but now I get notifications an hour or more after they occurred. What use is a security camera that tells you someone's in your driveway an hour later? It's one step forward, two steps back with everything Google touches.","Edit: One flaw I've been having as of the beginning of June this month is the Eco Mode (Home/Away assist) has developed a mind of it's own; Besides that, I love the Nest app! I only have the 3rd generation Nest thermostat and one sensor, but it has worked flawlessly for two years. I'm actually afraid to migrate to Google where the only possible benefit would be voice communication through Amazon or Google devices.

Also was able to connect my old printer. Yup, I have to buy a new printer because it's no longer supported.

Otherwise it is stunning. Payment is a little confusing. I was unsure whether to get Pro or Lite but went for Pro anyway.","Thank you for this great app, Can you add in the settings an option to change the place of taken picture review thumbnail after we take a shot, because the images I take the most important part of it is in left bottom of the image, and I need to wait for the thumbnail to disappear to be able take the next picture.

My only issue is when you are in live view and want to go to the gallery to look at the pictures, there's no simple way to go back to the live view screen. The only way I have found to do it is to click the liveview button on the camera and then open live view through the app again. Minor issue, but would be nice to have a back button so I can go back and forth easily between live view and gallery.","Exactly what I was looking for.

Every time I rename one of the adapters it just reverts after a few seconds to either the original name, or a random mix of characters taken from the name I want to give it and the name it originally had. Every option seems to be also achievable via the web interface. The actual hardware is great but this app is just pointless.","Would be 5 star for the product. But the app is basic and poorly designed! For example, why use pale blue text on a white background! How about a colour that contrasts more clearly so it can be read more easily. Dropped to 1 star. Only randomly detects 1 of my 2 extenders at a time. Very, very rarely seems to find the main adapter and both extensions.","Works well enough but why a separate app? Why not use the 'Tether' app? It would be much easier to add the Powerline adapters there and then you could look after your router and adapters in one app. It seems that some newer Powerline / range extenders work in 'Tether' app though, why not merge them all? Other than that works fine, just need to make sure you're connected to WiFi from the Powerline/Range extender, not the router to see the item and make any changes in the app. (Go sit near it)","The app seems to have little functionality, aside from being able to view the data rate, and turn the LED's off and on, there's not much else. I bought the devices & installed yesterday. The devices are working perfectly in the first 24 hours. Using this app to view each device properties, none of the passwords printed on the devices work. So I obviously need to look at TP-Link support pages for help in that direction. But I'm presuming there's a bug in the app.","Convenient but buggy and not the greatest User Experience. The custom device name is not retained. After saving the name it reverts back to the default name Device_XXXX. Detecting the PL devices generally takes quite some time. The app always starts with a message 'No Device Found', and then suddenly starts showing devices.

Easy to follow. And quick!","Great guidance and easy set up","Easy to use app, could do with more functions","This app is useless. It offers little to no functions and what it does offer is hit and miss. I am using a COVR-X 1873 with ethernet backhaul between the clients (extenders) and the master COVR (the one connected to the internet via the WAN port). In every other mesh system or wifi access point I have used, connecting an ethernet cable causes the device to preferentially use ethernet as the backhaul channel, as ethernet is more reliable and this eases congestion on the wifi which boosts client access speeds/bandwidth. But not these, oh no - it's a dark art with these things - there is a specific sequence of events that you have to follow to get a COVR extender to activate the ethernet backhaul to the COVR master - and it is almost certain that you will not accidently stumble across this sequence. Also the sequence is not included in any of the documentation available from D-link. I managed to get it working only because I contacted their chat support and together with a D-link support person we troubleshooted the issue in real time - to be fair, D-link support has been good. Finally - it wouldn't be so bad if this was the only issue but alas the firmware supplied on these things is CLEALRY NOT PRODUCTION ready. hardware wise they are nice looking, and pump out a strong signal but the FW instability and lack of any real controls in the GUI makes me wish I hadn't bought them.","App keeps crashing at last part of saving network password.

Never have had issues with the app, only the accompanying software for linux. Even then when you find the right versions it works flawlessly. I stopped using this for a while and used native solution inside of a custom rom. Since then though I have unrooted and relocked my bootloader, and am able to still tether my devices seamlessly by using this app again. 10/10 it makes my everyday easier. Thanks Dev.","As promised in my Lite review, my review of the Full version, after a few months of use. I seem to remember the initial setup was a bit of a hassle, but not too much, and afterwards it's generally required little maintenance in Ubuntu 18.04-20.04, a nice change from the flakiness I became irritated with my previous tether app. It isn't perfect: the Ubuntu interface is command line-only, and so far I have had to run it from there, once for every boot and occasionally again to restart it if there's an unusual problem. However, that's both infrequent and not hard, and the connection works well, so I'm content with the purchase.","3 stars for how easy it is to set up and install, that part is awesome But as far as the speeds that, so far, is not worth the 10$ to spend on it. I was downloading at 200kb/s Can't stream anything. Maybe just in a bad service area. Will update if anything changes.","Tried a similar usb tethering app (PDANET) and my connection would disconnect every 10 mins. The connection was also slow as i was getting around 4 mbps. I decided to purchase EasyTether Full and im glad i did! I have been using it for 2 days and not a single connection drop! I'm also getting 17 mbps! $9.95 is a steal for this app! My only suggestion is get rid of the free lite app. Its doesn't work with https sites and almost scared me off from purchasing the full app.","Disconnects and app crashes every 5 minutes on Kit Kat phone.  I factory reset, cleared cache and reflashed with fresh OS too, but still had the same problem.  The phone is fine, and PDAnet works fine on it too, but easy tether does not run stable on it for some reason.   This companies customer support is very bad.   Gave me nasty and not even relevant reply.  So giving them stars off for their poor customer service and for not knowing their own product.  Works ok on my non-kit kat phone though.  It is slow and pauses often when data at the phone is plenty good, but at least it doesn't disconnect every 5 minutes.  It is usable in a pinch when no other internet is available."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.mstream.easytether_polyclef","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mstream.easytether_polyclef&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Kasa Smart","description":"** Kasa Smart is currently only compatible with TP-LINK Smart Plug HS100/110/107 KP200/400, Smart Plug Mini HS103/105 KP105, Smart Switch HS200/210/220, Smart Power Strip HS300/303, Smart Bulb LB100/110/120/130/200/230, KL50/60/110/120/130, IP Camera KC100/105/110/115/120/200/300/310, Smart Router SR20, and Range Extender RE270/370/350K **\r\n\r\nKasa Smart lets you add, configure, monitor, and control your connected TP-LINK Smart Home devices from anywhere in the world.

You can only have three smart actions enabled at a time. It would be nice to use more (-1 star). You can schedule devices to turn on or off during a certain time of day. It needs the ability to group devices together so when one is on/off, they all match that setting. You currently need actions for that, which are limited. Ex. I use a switch to control two smart plugs.","Love home automation but.....one if my plug boards keeps switching on and off very quickly. There is no firmware update available and my devices are up to date. This us very frustration as several of my home devices switch on and of, all on the blinking an eye. As one is my washing machine it can stop the machine mid cycle leaving me unaware as to how far in the cycle the machine is and having to start again. There are updates for other kasa devices that have the same issue. Please fix.","This is one of the best smart apps I've used so far. It's clean, well-organized, and has a simple layout that anyone can use. The only thing that bugs me is that there's no dark mode for the app. When you sleep and wake at different times every day, it's difficult to wake up to a blinding white screen in order to turn on your devices. Since Google disabled the Assistant's ability to unlock your device so that it may process and activate commands \"hey turn on the lights\" is not an option for me."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.tplink.kasa_android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tplink.kasa_android&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Swaps: buy BTC, USDT crypto.

I swear by it. My newest laptop doesn't even recognize my cellphone but EasyTether gets through that obstacle and connects me easily to the internet. 1/1/2021 update: I have used this app through 3 different phones since the early 2000s. I started with Verizon Moto, next was Boost Mobile ZTE and finally a Cricket Samsung phone which connected 2 separate computers to the internet by 1 easytether app at the same time.","App is very useful. I would get the full version if it had IPv6 support. In my use case, I occasionally need to use IPv6 but I can't do that using this app. I was previously using Pdanet (which has IPv6) but it didn't support Linux and my OpenWRT router along with becoming unstable with recent updates.","Jumped through hoops to get it up for Debian 10, but after claiming it's connected, does nothing. Waste of time. UPDATE: The previous 1-star review still holds true for Debian 10, but under Ubuntu 18.04, it works as the setup information says it should. Of course, the Lite version isn't really good for much besides proving that it works and that you aren't getting cheated. Registration was a little confusing and seemed to suggest to me that if I wasn't careful, my registration would be tied to the phone, so I ended up just getting the Full version of the app. I'll provide further information about how that went later on.","This app works perfectly every time from Samsung phone to Samsung tablet via Bluetooth. Connects quickly and I'm sure to have a better browsing experience if I get the pro version. My only complaint is that it worked at home and hoping to use it in my vehicle android head unit but no such luck. I loaded the EasyTether Tablet version on my Andriod Tesla style radio and the usb connection says it's connected but i get no internet on the head unit.

Anyways this app is pretty garbage, just takes you to your built-in hotspot settings. There's people that want to share a hotspot connection but their phones don't have that feature yet you're just screwing around wanting that sweet ad revenue from all the people you baited.","Useless. I have Verizon network. Did not wsnt to pay for network HS where data goes through carrier. After installing this app it is searching for WIFI, WTH? If I had wifi I would not need a h/s would I. Takes you to mobile hotspit settings on phone. You cannot turn on mobile h/s as Verizon has it locked. Apparently you have to root your verizon phone or pay them. If other networks the same.

Early November 2020 update made the speed test all but useless. As far as I can tell it no longer shows the link speed to the access point. Without this it makes little sense to run a speed test. You can still get to it in a separate section of the app, but it is very cumbersome now.","This app is great. I've uninstalled my other Wi-Fi analyzer apps. I love how easy this is to use, and it gives you plenty of information if you walk around the site with the signal mapper. There's no reason to have dead spots after a site review with this app!","Good, no fuss app that does exactly what it states without fees or adverts etc. Once you start to learn your way around what is available within the app you find nearly everything you could want about your home broadband. Suggest that as it can show all your connected mobiles, routers, printers etc, it pays to turn them off individually so as you can see which is which on the results page. Also give each one an identifier so as you can record what/who is using the WiFi. Enjoy life. Bob S.","Very useful and also well designed app! Would recommend for a load of reasons 👍 But I do have a bit of feedback for the devs if they read: Even though the iOS version lacks a lot of features (I assume due to restrictions), one useful feature it has that this version doesn't is the option to add your own servers to ping (maybe even more elaboration on that feature could be useful). I also noticed it doesn't have any emphasis on IPv6 - the only time I've even seen one in the app was for the DNS.","No way to scan a custom network. No device history for previously scanned networks. Knows I'm connected to a VPN, and it finds the client-configuration specified gateway, giving me this info even though I have wifi off, I appreciate that! ..but cant scan that subnet for connected devices.

Entry to the crypto space is great. Following areas of improvement: the \"Slide/Swipe\" to buy is a bit weird as I'd prefer something like a button with less motion. The app could be made more snappier. Scrolling left/right to holdings performance is a bit weird. But aside from all that, I'm a fan of the product and business model. THE INTEREST IS JUST AWESOME 😎.","Be ready to pay a premium. You will always buy at the ask price and sell at the bid price. The difference on the app is 2-5%. So potentially u will lose 5% when you buy and when you sell. Most good exchanges the difference is way less than .05%... Here you are in the hole 10% by the time you cash out.

I updated the score to 4 stars. One improvement would be to keep people updated on support inquiries to prevent them from feeling forgotten.

Maybe they are just 'busy' but it's been two weeks since I submitted my ticket and I still haven't conversed with a human! Ergo, one star because the app installs. Nothing more as my BTC are still yet to be found since I 'smart' transferred them in. I would avoid this app at the present time based solely on the support experience. [edit] Support ticket#333616 has been responded to - thank you - +1 more star. [edit#2] - you mention refund but the ticket says the partner has all the info and to create a new PAYIN BTC. All very confusing. We will see. [edit#3]. They eventually refunded me, however based on this experience I still cannot recommend nor give > 2 stars - especially when they ask me to edit the review. If I had enough funds I would transfer what little BTC I have elsewhere and close the account.","For the most part I like the app alot. I transferred in out and exchanged numerous times with no problems. It's always worked smoothly before.....I sent 14.9 xrp \"with the correct tag number included\" ......and never recieved the xrp. I submitted a ticket. Waited. Then got an email saying they are backed up on tickets and are trashing all existing open tickets and to submit a new one. I did. It's been a week since I submitted the new one. Costumer Service at freewallet is a joke.","ticket ID is 315537 Update: The customer service officially provided me the things i needed to submit. And i sent their requirements, hopefully i got to access my account, finally. *Ratings may change depends on their response. Update: They fix my problem.

And why? I've never seen another app exchange ever have these issues. The date and time that was requested for payout or exchange should be honored. It was offered to the users as functional, and hasn't been the case on your end as promised.. These excuses are not acceptable. Compensation seems appropriate for start.","Apparently, the WORST app ever. Been trying to sign up since forever. I've re-installed the app severally.

I fear I would ever get singed into my account. Ticket#787115 Update: when I posted this, their team immediately replied this review pretending they care about their customers. But still no response to the ticket and my all money is lost. This is a real scam.","Worst experience using this app, they charge you ridiculous fees for withdrawal and the platform itself is stupid as it has no wallet so you need to have another wallet if you wish to take your own money out (whatevers left of it after theyve taken their massive cut) and yes they will claim they charge this fees for a safe transaction but others also have safe transactions but you dont see them overcharging!! Please do not use this!!","Worst crypto app. Trying for a month and half to restore my 2-FA due to device loss and still no answer from support.

For asking about your own money, it's infuriating!!","Just using browser version instead. App version lacks features that are available on the browser version.

Still slow with verification, but log in issues fixed. Don't know what you did but it works. Nice one","The app feels like an amateur hobby project. You have to log in each and every time you open the app and it asks you every time to set a PIN. Registration process was extremely buggy and is now stuck where the countdown resets to 24:00:00.","Now I understand why this app has only 2.9 stars...

Though if you have any sort of problem then it doesn't get addressed. Customer support is very poor and only reachable by email. It takes ages to get a response and most of the time it will not be a helpful one. Since this app deals with money it takes a huge hit because of customer care as there can't be any trust if you don't get clarification or resolution for your problems.","Good for nothing. Very very slow.. Very less users which means you end up in loss either buying or selling as there are few takers. They just hoard your funds. Can't withdraw. The process to contact customer care is a serious pain. Using this app is just a punishment for crypto lovers. Worst part is order placing. If you use your 100% funds to buy or sell. It tells you insufficient funds and by the time you redo. The price is gone and again loss. So in simple words. Loss loss loss and harrasment","App is gud but having some issue in open orders my open orders are still showing pending after 2 days which is not good as compare to other apps. Add another window in which we can directly purchased coins instead of waiting more on open orders. Coindcx is having separate window for dis. If u fix dis issue I will give 5 star","Worst aap ever, every time there was a problem with authenticator code or disable 2fa, it's has been 8 days my account is not responding, and after i book a ticket there is no response from support team. You have to improve you response and fix a bug lot of people are suffering","Every thing you done is great in this application. But there is some issues like lagging, not responding, and yes, make it remember my trading tool's like rsi, macd, all lines. Every time I have to redone everything and it's so frustrating. I am looking forward with this application. All though great great job with all the features. Keep it up and we will keep supporting team bit.

SoFi does not respond to emails at all, ever. It took a public Twitter message to get a response, and then they didn't even try to help me with it, just your pre-packaged \"we've forwarded the issue to our engineers!\" because that's ever true of any company. Unfortunately SoFi doesn't actually want your business, so better to go elsewhere.","I like having information on my cash, savings, credit, and investment accounts all in one place is nice. The tiles are a bit overwhelming at times though, something a little more minimalist and clean with a clear path to certain aspects of the app would be great. I occasionally feel lost when navigating through Relay and Money. The spending snapshot for relay is great, but I would like to be able to set spending budgets for each category in the future. Good app, great company.","I've done a few reviews on this app, but I felt the need to start fresh. This app is frustrating. They keep adding features, except those to to actually improve the app. There are no graphs to track your portfolio performance and you cannot do Stop loss orders or anything more advanced than a limit order. Also, the graphs on the stocks themselves rarely load. Just a spinning loading image. I'm continuously looking at other brokerages.","I actually really like this app, it's really user-friendly. You can learn as you go...and it's always being updated so there's fresh information everyday I absolutely have to say that this is my favorite app!💖💗 I have referred it to everyone I know on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. When you find something good you just gotta share!😇 Hey ,I hope you check this...I referred a friend but didn't get credit 😕 nor did my friend 😔 did we do something wrong?? Please help us if you can.","So I'm going to revisit my overall thinking of this bank SOFI- after utilizing some of the features and really diving into the APP, I can see a good thing, still have an issue with adding to my account, and there is still to much to follow on the \"FEED\", but, I found them to be more in depth then I had initially thought.

For example, Basic Security Level allows users to operate without worrying about private key safekeeping, by using simple PIN code instead. However, such simplicity comes with limitations.

All report excellent results. I also suffer from poor reviews from people that don't have enough knowledge to set up my app correctly. Why can't people just be humble and ask the developer for help in a nice fashion? As someone involved in networking on Android I am far enough away from the peak of Mt.

I am going to try a few more things....really hope it will work!!  UPDATE: I got it working again!!

It allows you to choose when the tethering should stop (Screen off or WiFi connected) to save battery on your devices. Application can automatically stop BT when is in idle or start if it is needed.  Moreover you can  create your own conditions using Locale, Llama and Trigger(only in PRO version).  You don't need to go to settings and manually start Bluetooth tethering (on server side) or connect to server device (on client side).

It allows you to choose when the tethering should stop (Screen off or WiFi connected) to save battery on your devices. Application can automatically stop BT when is in idle or start if it is needed.  Moreover you can  create your own conditions using Locale, Llama and Trigger(only in PRO version).  You don&#39;t need to go to settings and manually start Bluetooth tethering (on server side) or connect to server device (on client side).

But only works for Web browsing (http, https). Can you please add support for other protocols like email, P2P file sharing, FTP and more? I just want full access to the internet, not just browsing. Also, can you add an option for a sound alert and termination when my phone disconnects from WiFi, so I don't accidentally use my (expensive) data connection? Thanks, keep up the good work!","only app of this type that keeps working for me. Many work for a couple weeks or a month but your provider busts them sooner or later. sometimes it is finicky. you have to connect and disconnect a few sometimes, toggle airplane mode on both or restart the device(s) but soo far it keeps humming along. l use it almost all day on my tablet. it draws the battery but it's like it has a data plan. using s9+ and t6 Samsung galaxys","Like the app, but on my Samsung Galaxy S7 (SM-G930VL(GP) I can't get it to produce a password.
