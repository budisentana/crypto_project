Check out the Trending Assets on your home screen.  👍🏾 <br>We cleaned up the app to make it run smoother, just for you. We hope you notice 😁","comments":["I can recommend this app to millions of people. The app is so easy to operate. The security aspects is wow. The customer service is always at alert and ready to assist. You guys are wonderful.","the app is very good and adding cash is easy. just that it doesn't use graph to show the trend of cryptocurrencies. this is very important to determine when to trade. if you add that feature to make it 5 stars. I have to use another app just for checking the trend.also if are a cashlink agent could it be made possible to make deposits and withdrawals through yourself?","I just downloaded the app and the registration was seamless. I hope to get the best out of the app though am new to crypto but i believe this app will provide all that i needed. I have gone through all the reviews here and majority of the review is commendable and reliable. I hope the deposit and withdrawal aspect will be superb. The interface is cool and nice compared to other app. I cant wait to benefit immensely from the bundle application. I will still come back and do another review","This app is super cool and I love your platform though I have small issue with you people. the minimum coin tradable is not encouraging, sometimes you have a small amount you just want to buy few coins instead of spending it, but you people stated a particular amount that one must have to sell or buy. it is seriously discouraging.","Carrying transactions on the app is superfast, including the payout to your local bank account. Crypto transactions are seamless. The UI is super definative and thus easy to navigate. The email and in app notifications provides that extra layer of certainty when carrying out transactions in-app. A general great User Experience."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"africa.bundle.mobile.app","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=africa.bundle.mobile.app&hl=en&gl=au"}
