Even as is the features are profoundly better then most exchanges. Seeing all your funds in one place is a huge help. Join the telegram if you need to ask any questions Or if you would like to opt for new features. Not seen anyone work so hard on an app before and actually listen to the customers. ***Would like to see multi coin wallets introduced at some point and im sure they will be. 5***** all the way KEEP IT UP!!!","May 26, 2021 Loads fast now. Wows you did optimize it. Thank you - - _____ May 13, 2021 My internet WAS to slow to load it. 128 Kbps. App might need better optimization.","Best app so far,I hope the can build web version as well, I wish they can add binance smart chain wallet to see balance and more exchanges, like bitmax, monitoring wallet option would be game changer. Good luck Balveer","In New version reverse order is not automatically fill the amount","Looks promising. Please add 15 min and 1month time frames to TradingView charts.
