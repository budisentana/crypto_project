It keeps track of real-time coin prices,has a high level of security, and is user-friendly.","Stay away from this wallet... The Fees are so high.. even for the lop option especially when you are doing little transactions. I loaded 40 dollars BTC and I only spent 13$ the rest went into fees for two transaction trust me just use a regular wallet like Blockchain or binance.. this is my worst mistake today. You've been told","Excellent wallet for Bitcoin. Also manage multi cryptocurrency along with it best features are that this app can keep cryptocurrency safe and secured and also gives option to convert any cryptocurrency to Bitcoin. I love this app as it is easy to operate as well.","Fees are too high, and now it keeps on popping application error when i try to open it, i even updated it now as we speak but still it shows an application error.","Made a deposit into the wallet of 43 dollars now everytime I try to login it just freezes after I type my pin tried sending a ticket still no reply. .
