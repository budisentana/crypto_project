Used to be a 1 star review. Would give 4 stars but I had to go to support to figure out what the problem was and what was going on. They should do a better job at keeping their users in the loop. other other that, solid app. Would recommend.","Pretty good until maintenance on 4/10. Not sure how long this is supposed to last. No indication from app or webpage. So my BTG sits there and I can't do anything with it. Seems funny BTG price goes up maintenance. DOGE goes up guess what. Maintenance. Fishy.","Very cool Bitcoin Wallet for transfer with very easy to use, giving 4 stars because of sometimes getting sign-in error.","This is a super good Bitcoin gold wallet I really like the design and the logo is super clean","On the plus side is it super easy to use. On the negative you don't have your own private key."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"btg.org.freewallet.app","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=btg.org.freewallet.app&hl=en&gl=au"}
