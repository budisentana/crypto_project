People use it 'confident' for long as advanced DeFi tool solving the password big problem & capital concentration in custodial exchanges. Yet, some of us under surveillance of repressive 'intelligence' agencies that try to stop our access to DeFi, come back to 'restore' the wallet and, after being asked to lift eyebrows 100 times, and never recovering access, understand the political scam. Serious warning.","Facial Recognition fails. I never did QR backup. Good luck I only have 1 dollar there. I've been trying to access but to no use. I think I won't use this wallet anymore. My funds are lost?","The facial recognition doesn't work and I almost lost access to my wallet because of this.","Awesome wallet...highly recommended!!!
