Unlike Trust Wallet and other wallets, you just need the contract address, symbol, and decimals to add a custom token. It would be nice if they can improve the app by adding a custom token feature. I think more users will hold their coins/tokens in this app if they can have it. Until then, I will still prefer to use Trust Wallet over this app.","App has been good so far... But lately, I have been receiving different coin in my Tron wallet but this coin never reflect in my wallet. Shiba,One,NFT and the likes I just get a notification but coin doesn't reflect. I would like the kliver team to look into this. But the app has been very awesome tho.","I cant find myself giving the app more than 2 stars only because the minimum swap is set at $50.00 US dollars for TRX. I was hoping I could swap for much less but for that type of minimum. I could just buy the coin right from the other wallet where I am trying to use the swap for. TRX for BUSD $50+, plus a swap fee+withdrawal fee. Trustwallet purchase minimum of Smart Chain or BNB $50 no fee. I dont see what the point would be then. Please lower the minimum required for revelancy purposes.","Functionally Great. Absurd Fees! I like the functionality of the Klever app. Its the wallet I use for TRC-10 coins. It seems secure, it's very fast, and is easy to navigate once you learn all the features. The one thing I can't get over are the fees to purchase. I have never purchased anything from them because out of a $50.00 purchase they typically take about $14.00. Its secure for holding your crypto especially alt coins, has great staking interest, and is very fast with transfers.","I once gave this a 5 star but things have taken a turn for the worst. I recently encountered a problem with my phone and tried to restored my account with the Seed Phrase 12 words and all i'm getting is oops seed phrase is incorrect! how can this be? I had to write them down and re-enter them(in the EXACT SEQUENCE) when creating the wallet! now i'm told it's wrong, This is BS! I need help to retrieve my money."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"cash.klever.blockchain.wallet","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cash.klever.blockchain.wallet&hl=en&gl=au"}
