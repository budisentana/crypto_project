Easy switching between Ethereum and TRON Blockchains and different wallets. Recents and Favorites make dApps flow easy. Address book contacts save to the Klever mnemonic phrase so when restoring to new device, contacts restore also.","I once gave this a 5 star but things have taken a turn for the worst. I recently encountered a problem with my phone and tried to restored my account with the Seed Phrase 12 words and all i'm getting is oops seed phrase is incorrect! how can this be? I had to write them down and re-enter them(in the EXACT SEQUENCE) when creating the wallet! now i'm told it's wrong, This is BS! I need help to retrieve my money.","App is ok but you can't add a token which are not listed in the app. So you can only hold limited coins/tokens. Unlike Trust Wallet and other wallets, you just need the contract address, symbol, and decimals to add a custom token. It would be nice if they can improve the app by adding a custom token feature. I think more users will hold their coins/tokens in this app if they can have it. Until then, I will still prefer to use Trust Wallet over this app.","Functionally Great. Absurd Fees! I like the functionality of the Klever app. Its the wallet I use for TRC-10 coins. It seems secure, it's very fast, and is easy to navigate once you learn all the features. The one thing I can't get over are the fees to purchase. I have never purchased anything from them because out of a $50.00 purchase they typically take about $14.00. Its secure for holding your crypto especially alt coins, has great staking interest, and is very fast with transfers.","Something I liked about the pre klever wallet was seeing every balance . Now I can add the token to my list and it says 0.0 even though I can see the transaction in . 5 stars when that's fixed . Everything else is great ."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"cash.klever.blockchain.wallet","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cash.klever.blockchain.wallet&hl=en&gl=au"}
