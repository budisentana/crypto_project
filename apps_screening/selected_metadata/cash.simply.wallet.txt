Better then eny other bitcoin apps and comes with sweeping and giving, my favorite part is that you can transfer bitcoin TO PAPER litterly able to save money in paper i highly recommend simply cash","Best wallet available. Light weight and you can use it to turn an old phone into a cold wallet. No fluff just simple and secure.","I like the the wallet but I have troubles to connect to internet a lot of times which its certainly unsettling. I thought it needed some kind of upgrade but there is no upgrade available... I don't know why I'm having this connection issues happening...","Simple yet effective for sending & receiving BSV. I have heard that it is not tied to the cell service so will work with just wifi and thus has application for turning an old cell phone into a cold storage wallet which I'm interested in checking out. Has a handle system as well & I was able to send from Handcash 2.0 to simply.cash handle so already good integration with my other favorite cell wallet which is nice","I can't seem to do anything with this app. Got sent $50 and couldn't do anything with it. Ended up deleting the app by accident and reinstalled it. No way to log into my original account and get that $50."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"cash.simply.wallet","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cash.simply.wallet&hl=en&gl=au"}
