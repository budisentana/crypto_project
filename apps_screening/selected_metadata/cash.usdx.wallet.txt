{"title":"USDX Wallet - blockchain wallet with stable crypto","description":"Make money transfers on the go: quickly, securely and without any commission fees.\r\n\r\nUSDX Wallet is a blockchain-based cryptowallet made for instant money transfers. It features USDX ‚àí a stable cryptocurrency pegged to the U.S. Dollar.  Setting up an account in the wallet takes only a minute. And best of all, there are no fees for payments in USDX.\r\n\r\nThe wallet‚Äôs security is implemented at multiple levels. The primary defense is asymmetric cryptography, which is an essential component of cryptocurrencies. Your private key is encrypted and stored safely; only you can decrypt it and perform transactions. The use of distributed ledger technology ensures that all transactions are irreversible. Moreover, your account is linked to your mobile phone number, preventing unauthorized access and enabling two-step authentication. Every transaction must be confirmed with a code from a push notification or SMS. Lastly, the app auto-locks after several minutes of inactivity and requires a PIN code, fingerprint or face scanning to unlock.\r\n\r\nUSDX cryptocurrency is pegged to the much-used USD at a 1:1 ratio, making it easy to figure out your balance or calculate the amount to transfer. Having no transaction fees, USDX stablecoin acts perfectly as a means of payment.\r\n\r\nThe Lighthouse coin, or LHT, is a core cryptocurrency of the USDX Wallet. The total supply of LHT is 1B coins, which will be released gradually to the market. A smart contract ensures that each USDX token is collateralized with at least 200% worth of LHT currency. Only 10% of the LHT supply will be issued each year, of which 5% will be freely tradeable and 5% will be locked on the blockchain to provide 200% collateralization.\r\n\r\nWhy choose USDX Wallet\r\n\r\n‚úîÔ∏è Zero fees\r\nWe want a stable currency to be available for everybody - so we‚Äôve eliminated commissions. Make borderless transfers with 0% fee.\r\n\r\n‚úîÔ∏è Fast and easy transactions\r\nInstantly send funds to your friends by mobile phone number, name from Contacts, their USDX Wallet account name, or personal QR code. Easily repeat regular transactions. Get your real-time balance and a full history of transactions at any time.\r\n\r\n‚úîÔ∏è High-grade security\r\nDue to blockchain technology, all wallet transactions are verified, stored in a distributed ledger and can‚Äôt be compromised. Each transaction is confirmed using two-factor authentication (2FA). This means your funds are safely protected against seizure and it‚Äôs nearly impossible to make a transfer without your permission. For extra security, the app requires a fingerprint, a face-scanning or a PIN code upon every entry and after some period of inactivity.\r\n\r\n‚úîÔ∏è Money-back guarantee\r\nIf you‚Äôre not satisfied with the service, we will return your money back, no questions asked. \r\n\r\n\r\nHow to get USDX or LHT?\r\nYou can buy USDX and LHT currencies for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Dash and over 50 Altcoins right in the app. Also, you can exchange LHT for USDX and vice versa at any time without paying additional fees. Coins are currently listed on four exchanges: Exrates.me, Exmarkets.com, P2PB2B.io and Alterdice.com. More exchanges are coming soon.\r\n\r\nStay tuned as we are constantly adding new features to make USDX Wallet more powerful and convenient üí™üèª.

I've uninstalled and reinstalled, allowed all permissions and still nothing. By the way, developers, if you're gonna put fake reviews on your product, at least make them less obviously fake. The five star ratings that are written for this app are faker than a three-dollar bill.","Cant connect to network.. seem to be the case for many people. Just fix it for crying out loud. And dont ask me to ''contact support''. Just Fix It","Won't let us log in to our account. App is completely useless now. We couldn't touch the funds we have to our account. Fix it.","Not just a regular Crypto wallet. First thing first SECURITY : A+, undoubtly holds a higher level of security so worry less. Faster transactions and that too with NO FEES. Wow! Couldnt be better. UI is as user friendly as it could have been with added live charts for the specific assets. Lastly the money back guarantee, great! Who else can offer that?
