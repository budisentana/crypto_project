Luno lies to you, its UI and UX is designed to make you buy and sell as many times as possible, which would make them money. You will lose a lot of your money to the fees, and it would be because you got tricked into buying at a higher price than it is shown. Take it from me, I lost almost 900, thinking that green candle means good to buy.","Usage has been smooth for some months now, until recently... I lost my device and got a new one. All efforts to login with my details have been ineffective. I mean, you guys have my email address and phone number, why so difficult to redeem my account when I have assets in there?","Hi, This is good and very easy to use, but one thing it's slow moving when trading also the prize and the graph not moving at the same time. Need to improve. Also only have a few coins for trade, need more coins for trading. Tq","I lost my phone in December 2019 and I've been trying to contact the \"LUNO support team\" without success. Worse part, recently I can't log a complain because I'm receiving a \"Too many complains at the moment, please try again later\" messages. 🙄 I even tried accessing luno support team via skype without success... but within hours since i contacted the support team again today, my account was solved😉 thanx LUNO team🙏","I paid R20 for an express clearing which they claim takes 15 min, nearly an hour an half later im still waiting. I reported it in the \"help\" menu and they said it might take up to 2 days just to respond to my \"help\" request.. so basically they are charging me R20 for nothing as I still need to wait as long is it would take an average transaction.. dont use the express withdrawal! \"Update\" over 3 hours later they cancelled my withdrawal and couldn't provide a valid reason! Unacceptable!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"co.bitx.android.wallet","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.bitx.android.wallet&hl=en&gl=au"}
