A must get!","Can't even type to register or login. All my other apps are fine so it's Edge that's bugged. This doesn't leave me with a lot of confidence.","Mostly good, except your Monero is broken. I currently have 1.77μ. I can not use it, however, because your app says I have a spendable balance of 0. No ... I have 1.77μ. It says it right there, right under where it says I don't. I better still have my coin.","One of the most secure Crypto Wallet that supports all useful coins. The new UI is awesome 😎. Update: It would be nice to have bech32 address format for Bitcoin","I finally found the only wallet than got accepted for a specific app. I looked everywhere, tried many wallets but none worked. Until i found this one. I can't appreciate how easy and secure it is to create an account. No email. What i also like is how you can keep everything under your watch and be up to date with any changes made to the cryptocurrencies. I recommend it to everyone needing a nice, secure and convenient wallet"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"co.edgesecure.app","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.edgesecure.app&hl=en&gl=au"}
