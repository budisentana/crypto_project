Last updated in January 2020. Since then the app has been temperamental, I noticed it would start loading and then would crash, blue screen. I'd have to try a few times to see my balances but after the Android 11 update, no matter how many times I try I cant open the app. The support email on Google play store and their website is not a valid address, have tried to email countless times with bounce backs, I'm at a loss as to what to do as I have funds tied up in this lame app.","Thought I'd give this a try, and its actually pretty awesome! Owning the private keys is obviously very important, but what i really like is that the app also makes it easy to swap my crypto currencies for fiat cash at local destinations too. One of the most complete bitcoin wallets out there","The app keeps crashing everytime i go to open it. Ive deleted and redownloaded it several times but its the same","I love the app but no initiative to add tezos or lots of other alt coins before the bull run been sticking with ya guys but no development on getting more coins before bull run and halving could've made alot more money have to use other apps that do more than you guys already gonna just prolly move all my funds elswhere Edit: sent some monero too app and can't get it out seems like an exit scam","Easy and straightforward to use."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"co.satoshiwallet.app","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.satoshiwallet.app&hl=en&gl=au"}
