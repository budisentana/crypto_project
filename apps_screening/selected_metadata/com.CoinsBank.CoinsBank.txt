Once you put your money in it you can't take it out. And even if you try they will charge you a lot of fee, the maximum withdrawal is 30$ in BTC and they charge you for that 200$, and let's not mention that if you exchange between two type they will give you 75% lesser than the market price. And when I tried to take out my money even losing all of that after sending the support multiple messages, they now blocked me from entering my wallet.","App gets stuck right from the beginning, at entering the Master Password. Continuously says 'Authorization failed'. Please help with solution. Also, when will physical Coinsbank debit cards be available for order?","Trying to sign up and get nothing but \"service not available\"","Please am unable to login I don't have the phone number I use registered it what can I do ???","This App is fake , they hold our money and no refund no reply they are fake Don't trade Be careful Google have to remove this app"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.CoinsBank.CoinsBank","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.CoinsBank.CoinsBank&hl=en&gl=au"}
