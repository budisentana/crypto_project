Got deleted. I have my passcode but not the recovery answers (not both of them) I emailed for help and was just told JUST download the new one edge wallet if you can recover your password. Talk about absolutely disregarding my request for help. I see everyone here finally got some help with the same issue I am having. What a waste of time when your customer service doesn't even listen. Isn't that job to solve problems not disregard!","The company locks you out of the old app permanently with no way of recovering the account if you don't know the full password even if you know the PIN. Reading the other reviews on Google Play apparently this is a widespread problem with airbitz / Edge UPDATE they reactivated the old airbitz servers long enough to login with the pin and change the password in order to transfer the account to Edge","Transaction still pending after a month, funds basically lost because I can't reverse transaction or retry it on Edge","I broke my last phone that had the wallet, and wanted to load it onto a new phone, I could not get it to work. The service from the support team was quick and helpful. It took some time, but I am back in. Thank you. (On a side note, if you are still using airbitz, I recommend you go over to edge as soon as you can)","I have used this months ago and it worked so went to use again. I have money on the account and it wont even let me log in. Just gives me a loading screen. So now they have stolen my money. Dont use."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.airbitz","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.airbitz&hl=en&gl=au"}
