{"title":"Atomex - Crypto Wallet & Atomic swap DEX","description":"Atomex — is a non-custodial crypto wallet with a built in Atomic swap decentralized exchange (DEX). You can store, use and swap cryptocurrencies between different blockchains like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), Tezos (XTZ) as well as tokens USDT (ERC20 token), tzBTC (Tezos wrapped Bitcoin), TBTC, WBTC (Ethereum wrapped Bitcoin) without intermediaries from your mobile wallet.\r\n\r\nWhat makes Atomex wallet special?\r\nAtomex Hybrid exchange combines advantages of centralized and decentralized exchanges:\r\n• You're in control: Private keys are kept encrypted on your mobile wallet. Cross-blockchain transactions are carried out using Atomic Swaps.\r\n• No additional fees: You pay only a miner fee for both regular and cross-blockchain atomic swap transactions.\r\n• Stay incognito: No registration or identity verification required because Atomex is a non-custodial cryptocurrency wallet.\r\n• Audited: All blockchain atomic swap smart-contracts and crypto wallet core library audited by LeastAuthority.\r\n• Staking Tezos: Delegate your Tezos (XTZ) to trusted bakers from the Baking Bad list and bring an income.\r\nWhat is Atomic Swap exchange?\r\nAtomic swap is a technology for secure exchange of digital assets without the need to trust a third party. It’s as secure as cryptographic primitives and blockchain implementation it's based on. It's mathematically proved that in every scenario you either succeed with an exchange or get your money back. Atomex uses an on-chain implementation based on hashed timelock smart-contracts.\r\n\r\nHow long does an atomic swap take?\r\nDepending on the chosen pair of cryptocurrency, the exchange may take from several minutes to an hour. The maximum time is 6 hours, after which the coins are returned to your crypto wallet.\r\n\r\nHow are private keys stored?\r\nYour private keys are stored ONLY on your mobile wallet device, encrypted using AES-256. You have to unlock your crypto wallet with the encryption password on every start.\r\n\r\nStaking Tezos\r\nStake Tezos (XTZ) from your own wallet with a delegation function. It brings passive income automatically. Delegation in Tezos is absolutely safe. Your coins are not locked or frozen and do not move anywhere. You can spend them at any time and without any delay from your Atomex wallet. Just keep in mind, you only delegate your rights, that’s it. Atomex wallet uses Tezos Baking Bad baker’s list.

But clearly some issues to be ironed out. Tried restoring the wallet that I set up and ran into problems: app said one of the words in the seeding phrase, \"consensus,\" is not on the list of seeding words for the language selected, which was English. That scared me, esp as I'd set up the wallet in English. Thankfully the wallet was empty otherwise I'd have been majorly screwed. PS: Thanks for your reply. Just to add, my seeding phrase 12 words. I took a pic of it with a polaroid.","Atomex is the best wallet I came across, thank you for the easy interface. Way better and trustworthy. Thank you for developing this. Awesome. Best wishes.","It's my first crypto wallet. Easy to try it with a Testnet account before to use it for real coins. Cool!","This is very impressive . my friend recommended this once but i ignored and dont intall it . but one day i need of money then i have to wish in my mind to make money then i requested to my friend to show the name of app he recommend me this and i never believe that i am successful in this app now","you need to add more crypto on your wallet not useful enough on the choices you have"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.atomex.android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atomex.android&hl=en&gl=au"}
