This application is designed on the principle of ease of use and convenience, you will be able to enjoy unique functions while transferring your bitcoins.

The main thing is to store and exchange your cryptocurrencies here as securely as possible. I really like this app.","Why can't i log in? I did not expect coinmama advert on the login page. I never joined coinmama at all. I registered for bcoiner not coinmama. I sent bitcoins here and it's very horrible now there is no login page at all at bcoiner's !! Bcoiner's admins, why this??????","It takes a littlw studying to understand but after you apply yourself a few times it becomes easier to navigate your way around the app. Definately a good digital coin investment app.","I love this app. I like how simple to add the amount and cost of several coins to see the actual increase or decrease portfolio value"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.bcoiner.webviewapp","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bcoiner.webviewapp&hl=en&gl=au"}
