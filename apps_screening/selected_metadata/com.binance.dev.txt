Every week they give an update. Every week all your settings are gone. Tradingview for the win! Custommer support not reachable. i tried to reach them for 6 weeks, 3 seperate complaints. 2 sessions attemps on the chat. 50 emails. We still arent any further. Money is gone due to a weird error and they are not really willing to help you... after all this time and more emails and more explenation. I maybe got all of it back.","I have transferred €1000 and it has gone missing. I have tried contacting the customer service but they just copy and paste the same thing. I have provided the proofs and they have asked me 3 times to resubmit it which was also done and I have received again an email saying to do the same thing again. Is it a joke?? I was happy up to this happened but it is really annoying specially as the customer service is just disaster","Absolutely awful. Try to verify and the obtuse unless software can't tell the difference between a hand and a beard so can't get any further. 2 days of trying to speak to a hunan and you've got no chance!! Just get idiotic blood boiling automated \"AI\" messages which I hate at the best of times. Absolute cowboy of a company!! EDIT: They have removed fiat deposit/withdrawals for UK customers without saying a word to anyone. Very unprofessional behaviour but grown to expect it from these people.","Nice app but the only thing I don't like about this app is that anybody that want to verify his/her ID it must be a plastic one, but it's not everybody that has the plastic one, some get there own like last year. Why not use the one that we have before the plastic one will come out. Please I'm abegging you people to do something about it.","Was a great app to use but suddenly since the UK imposed a ban, customers can't withdraw and deposit money into the exchange. There is zero information provided and no timeframe to the solution. What are customers supposed to do and customer service is useless on binance. Really dissapointing!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.binance.dev","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.binance.dev&hl=en&gl=au"}
