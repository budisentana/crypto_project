But it needs several updates. Graph shown isn't as accurate as Binance and some other exchanges out there. Support doesn't really support when something goes wrong. I'll stick with the app carrying hope that Bitbns team will work it all out to make it a flawless exchange.👍","Good for nothing. Very very slow.. Very less users which means you end up in loss either buying or selling as there are few takers. They just hoard your funds. Can't withdraw. The process to contact customer care is a serious pain. Using this app is just a punishment for crypto lovers. Worst part is order placing. If you use your 100% funds to buy or sell. It tells you insufficient funds and by the time you redo. The price is gone and again loss. So in simple words. Loss loss loss and harrasment","My ticket ID- 293701 I can't able to withdraw my amount , Ridiculous, in emergency case what I can do if the app doing like this. Very poor support agency. Dear team , if I not get my withdrawal tomorrow, sure I will raise a big complaint about the app in all aspects. It's almost 7 days , for my medical checkup I withdrawn but you made me mad on this. I have used wazirx, Zebpay, COIN switch, Coindcx, but never faced this issue. It is totally unfair . One guy name Navin vaid asking to t","The app works fine as far as usability goes. Though if you have any sort of problem then it doesn't get addressed. Customer support is very poor and only reachable by email. It takes ages to get a response and most of the time it will not be a helpful one. Since this app deals with money it takes a huge hit because of customer care as there can't be any trust if you don't get clarification or resolution for your problems.","Every thing you done is great in this application. But there is some issues like lagging, not responding, and yes, make it remember my trading tool's like rsi, macd, all lines. Every time I have to redone everything and it's so frustrating. I am looking forward with this application. All though great great job with all the features. Keep it up and we will keep supporting team bit. Thank you, and I personally think it has a potentiality to improve and impact on crypto market and economy."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.bitbns","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bitbns&hl=en&gl=au"}
