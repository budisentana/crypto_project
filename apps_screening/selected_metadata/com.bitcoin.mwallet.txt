The app auto rotates horizontally but in the wrong way for me. My charge port is on the bottom of my table and my cable is on the left. This auto rotate only flips right and won't flip to the left. So i now have a long cable across my lap because of it and this puts undue stress on the charge. Then when trying to watch a vid in app it flips the other way. Wth! Very annoying! Maybe it is not optimized for a tablet but in this day and age it should be!","I love this app!! It works like a charm. I linked it to my Google account & immediately transferred BTC to my wallet with ease & then transferred from there to where I really needed it. Whole process took less than an hour & the total cost less than 4%. Thank you for making the often complex & expensive transfer of crypto currency quick, easy, & effecient.","Used daily for three months. Love the ability to open a few wallets of the same crypto in order to segregate my transactions. Also can include personal notes for both incoming and outgoing transactions to keep tabs of sending and receiving. Both of these features may not be available in other wallets. Hope to see more crypto supported, so that I can streamline my wallets.","Really great app for sending and storing bitcoin. I accidentally sent Bitcoin to my Bitcoin cash address, which I've lost money doing before and instantly regretted my mistake thinking I lost a lot of money. But it automatically went to my Bitcoin wallet instead. Super grateful if this is a feature of the app, will definitely used this from now on! Thank you so much","finally, an easy way to buy and send bitcoin, with no sending minimum, and no issues adding my PayPal card. verification was fast, so was first purchase, even though it said, may take a couple hrs, it was only a few minutes. sending has so far been instant. yay!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.bitcoin.mwallet","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bitcoin.mwallet&hl=en&gl=au"}
