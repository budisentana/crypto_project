","comments":["Wallets have been and are being worked on and updated for a while now. Everything should be fine. Downloaded the wallet , no issues , connected my wallet address to my BCB rewards account, no issues. Promoting BCB now.... We'll see how it goes. So far so good. Unfortunately I missed the presale by 1 day . Looking forward to the future with BCB !","Things were running smoothly till 3 days ago. I haven't been able to view my balance and now i can't see my transactions. The app has a glitch and for it to have gone on this long is upsetting me as i was in the middle of buying more BCB when this started. You'll get your 5 stars after this glitch is rectified.","I've bought a couple BCB with this app but I can't view my balance. What sort of nonsense is that??? I don't understand what's going on. This has to be fixed ASAP or I'm going to leave a worse review than this!!","I would have rate the app 5 star but am having issue with my wallet backup cause i changed my phone but for me to restore my wallet with my 24 words is now the problem am facing(have input it several times and it does not restore without giving any error message so i dont know why i cant backup my wallet. Damm tired","My wallet has not been opening for a month now, it just keeps loading in a blurring format for hours without showing anything. Just blurry blinking lines I've logged out and login again but the problem persist. Cause of that I can't access my funds Pls fix this"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.bitcoinblack.wallet","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bitcoinblack.wallet&hl=en&gl=au"}
