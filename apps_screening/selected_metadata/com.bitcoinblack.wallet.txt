","comments":["Wallets have been and are being worked on and updated for a while now. Everything should be fine. Downloaded the wallet , no issues , connected my wallet address to my BCB rewards account, no issues. Promoting BCB now.... We'll see how it goes. So far so good. Unfortunately I missed the presale by 1 day . Looking forward to the future with BCB !","Things were running smoothly till 3 days ago. I haven't been able to view my balance and now i can't see my transactions. The app has a glitch and for it to have gone on this long is upsetting me as i was in the middle of buying more BCB when this started. You'll get your 5 stars after this glitch is rectified.","I've bought a couple BCB with this app but I can't view my balance. What sort of nonsense is that??? I don't understand what's going on. This has to be fixed ASAP or I'm going to leave a worse review than this!!","Love the app... But recently app won't stop loading, can't view either balance or transaction.... It just won't stop loading Jsyk IT SUCKS :) please fix it","Wallet doesn't work, stuck syncing. Been in this project a long time. Anyone says 5 stars is a fake review. No news on progress of project. Feeling it's a scam."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.bitcoinblack.wallet","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bitcoinblack.wallet&hl=en&gl=au"}
