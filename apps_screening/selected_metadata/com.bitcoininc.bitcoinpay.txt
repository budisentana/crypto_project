It is stressful to interact with. It only receives btc but does not pay out.","i think its better to download there edge wallet app pls dont use this app( it ate my money but i found it on there edge wallet app).","i don't know how to make a deposit.","Do not download this app and never upload your $ to this wallet,  because it doesn't provide you a transfer section,  means you can deposit but can't withdraw. Useless and scam app. Lucky I didn't deposit with big amount. Today you can keep my 16$ but this review will make others know about you and not be scammed by you!","This is not a great app. I signed up and took a payment then told they don't allow U.S. based accounts. Can't even get my money. Enjoy my 350 :)"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.bitcoininc.bitcoinpay","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bitcoininc.bitcoinpay&hl=en&gl=au"}
