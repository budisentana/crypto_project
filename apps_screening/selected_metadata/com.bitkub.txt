Kept on getting decline. What's so hard about verifying .","Tried to open account with Bitkub. After long time waiting, my account was 2 times rejected. If you are a foreigner and you have the possibility to have an account outside Thailand, than for sure this is a better choice. As foreigner you are treated differently than thai people. Something we can't imagine in our home countries","Still crashed when launching after the new update.","Never verify foriegn citizens on Thailand . This is another racism application from Thai nationality, and another reason that foriegn run away from this country and never come back for investment. My wife is Thai and approved in less than 1 day but for foriegn this is normal in this country. They can't even let you try to approve just reject and go.
