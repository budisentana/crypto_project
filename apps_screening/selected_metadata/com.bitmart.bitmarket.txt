I haven't had a problem until 3 weeks ago when randomly my biometric sign-in was disabled and now required my username and password. After entering the correct password it kept saying it wasn't correct, so I changed my password successfully according to Bitmart. After changing my pass I still was getting the \"Incorrect password/username\" error and yes, I was using the correct ones. No customer service to speak of.","I have been locked out of my account for a month now. I have done password resets to my email and to phone for text message and still have not receive any notification for reset. I have email customer support several times and received no answer. I have started a chat and nobody came online. This app is horrible and a scam do not use it. I have money and crypto on my account and can not access it in 45 days. Do not use bitmart they do not respond. I am loosing money for not being able to trade.","I would say that customer service for this app is horrible but it's not even that good. It doesn't exist at all. The app shows several ways to contact them but they don't respond to any of them. I transferred crypto into this wallet from coinbase. The transfer was successful on coinbase's end but I still have not seen any of that crypto show up in my bitmart wallet. I contacted them 5 times on the different options they give in the app. Two months later I still have not heard back from them.","Update links don't work. Long story short, when you go to play store you have to physically type in \"BITMART UPDATE\" and I was finally able to make the update and get back into the app. I personally wouldn't put too much money on this app. Nothing more frustrating than having to figure things out in a time crunch moving your money around.","Been great until today. Now it says \"latest UPDATED\" (updated?) then i press the \"updated? now\" button and it keeps bringing me back to the app store. The \"updated? later\" option is greyed out. Then in the app store it says OPEN... hit OPEN then the process starts over again. In short i can't access my account or my money now. Please help EDIT: I uninstalled... reinstalled and restarted my phone then it gave me the option to UPDATE and all is good in the world again lol"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.bitmart.bitmarket","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bitmart.bitmarket&hl=en&gl=au"}
