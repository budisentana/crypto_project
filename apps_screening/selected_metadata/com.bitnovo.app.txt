You should simplify the product/service, not make it more dificult and confusing for possible users. Blockchain is already confused enough to the mainstream. I would suggest to keeping it simple. Wirex provides more services than you do, and only has 1 app and 1 website. Will update after using the service with some consistency. Keep up the good work!","As others have mentioned the id process is extremely complicated and they request id every time. Secondly their fees are outrageous and hidden DON'T TRUST THEIR WEBSITE, I was charged 8 EUR to buy about 80 EUR of bitcoins on top of the exchange rate that is already inflated , in total ended up paying 12%+ of fees, dishonest business","I asked for money back and they promised me that it will be refunded in a month. On today's date it is almost two months and nothing happened. Very disappointed...","after reading the reviews and realize it was nothing more than a garbage application that scams you out of fees I immediately uninstalled it after installing it without ever even opening it and I'm glad I did! Thank you to everybody for leaving your reviews about your nightmare stories of getting ripped off by this cheap disgusting dishonest trash company...","I purchased cryptocurrency did all verification process selfie with id etc... And they still didn't pay my wallet, send 3 email to support team no reply at all. Wish I could give 0 star. You can keep that money if that's what you have decided, will be leaving review on other platforms too."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.bitnovo.app","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bitnovo.app&hl=en&gl=au"}
