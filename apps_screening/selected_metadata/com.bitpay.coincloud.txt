Loosing wallet information Download this app. It will find your lost wallets for sure without you even having to request. Just download trust and make an accout","For everyone saying their funds don't show up. Go to your settings, then click key 1, click your account you sent it to, then click the blue button that says scan for funds. Mine didn't show up for 24 hours and after I did this boom it was there. I thought I had been scammed but I guess you just have to do that to get the account to know it has btc in there","Excellent App! I did my first sell btc transaction on the app for $500. Transacted on the app and picked up my payment at a coin cloud ATM about a mile from my house. From app sell to pickup, the entire process was done in 1 hour! Very fast transaction..... LOVE IT!!!","Don't use the machine. Charged me %25 transaction fee. Good way to invest $200 and lose $50 immediately. Fastest I ever lost $50.","I bought bitcoins and my purchase was verified but 10 days later it still doesn't show up in my wallet. Have tried contacting support and get no response so apparently am just out over $100. Use caution if you use this app."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.bitpay.coincloud","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bitpay.coincloud&hl=en&gl=au"}
