Just \"coming soon click to be notified\" no thank you with your misleading marketing ðŸ˜¤","Using the app as a secondary wallet and for the gift card redeeming feature really makes the app worth it. It's seamless and the UI is very easy to navigate.","Wow this app is great!!! I was on the waitlist to receive my card it came through and I use it daily.","Beware!! App works and the MasterCard works great. There is an undocumented \"miners fee.\" For a $50 Bitcoin to card transfer there was $3.35 Bitcoin fee and a $25 \"miners fee,\" beware!!","(Edit: OK I officially dislike BitPay one more notch.Trying to get the app to work on another device screwed up the old device without changing anything on the old device. Luckily I think I only lost $0.82 in BCH. Still not happy about it) Original: Having trouble with this \"new\" experience. Not sure why they decided to make so many changes at once. Bad move for a young company. Still trying to get the app to work. Will try to remember to update once I have an update to post."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.bitpay.wallet","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bitpay.wallet&hl=en&gl=au"}
