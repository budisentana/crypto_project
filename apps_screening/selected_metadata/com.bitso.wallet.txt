I've used the app since December 2020 and never had any issues while making a deposit or withdrawing, during weekends withdrawals take some time (matter of hours) but always arrive.","3 stars for android app. iOS app looks good which is having more options. When limit order functionality will be provided for Android users?","Extreme high fees, wrong price update, constant \"too many requests\" prompts, buggy user interface, did I say this app has high fees already?","Does not have some essential capabilities for me, like being able to set bid price and to cancel pending orders.","Love this app!
