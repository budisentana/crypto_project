Regardless of how many code requests placed, the email does not arrive. Update: the customer support is very efficient. At this time though, receiving the confirmation withdrawal code doesn't show up, despite the sending of the code is still happening.","Worst verification experience ever! I have been trying to verify for months using all methods available but it always fails verifying. I even contacted customer support and sent them photos of my ID, after a month they replied by sending generic message that I need to verify my identity in the app?! Useless app for me, I will try Crypto and Celsius app. Don't bother installing this one!","I won't be linking any bank account through Plaid that I can't enter manually. I use several other apps that use Plaid and I could find the option to enter the routing/account number. Either BlockFi removed the option, Plaid did, or I don't care...no one gets my login/password. That's 30 year old advice. Bring back the option to manually enter banking info and we can do business.","The App is just horrible. I can't sign in for days. Always telling me I'm offline!! Never keep me signed in. Lower their interest! I'll stay for a while to see if any improvement. If not I have to find a replacement","Great tool for investing to earn interest on stablecoin or other cryptos. Combine it with the credit card and it's a super valuable investment vehicle for newbies and experienced alike. Runs great on my phone, seems to have pretty robust security as well!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.blockfi.mobile","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blockfi.mobile&hl=en&gl=au"}
