Fees are ~1% which is lower than the coinbase basic app. With the addition of 8% interest on all deposits up to 10k, and 5% on amounts higher than that, it's really the best app for inexperienced crypto users right now.","So far so good. Super easy to navigate. Really wish we could withdraw coins/tokens to TrustWallet. Maybe in a future update? Other than that things are working as they should and devs are always updating the app.","The buttons are unresponsive, and there is a long lag time. I often have to open and close the app just to get it responsive again. Also, when scrolling between portfolios, the process lags as well with a blank screen coming up when I try to scroll between portfolios instead of seeing the actual portfolio. This is highly frustrating. I would like a developer to please get in contact with me. Having to tap these buttons 10x over for just one action is really grating. Awful user experience.","It's fine, but it's hard to understand why it doesn't show Profit/Losses (for each coin and total) on the portfolio view, that's shown already when clicking on each coin so the implementation should be trivial. I'll add another star the day they do that (already done by Delta), and yet another when a graph showing gains/loss and basis cost (already done in Koinly) is added. Since there are no plans to do something this trivial I removed a star.","I like this app, I really do!, but I'm considering moving to a different app. It's unbelievable in this day and age that although I can put money instantly, it takes days to get money out. The only option given is international money wire!.This takes days, and your charged a fair amount to transfer YOUR money to YOUR account! Considering they already take a cut from every coin purchase and sale, this is just shocking. Taking YOUR money out should not be this expensive."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.blockfolio.blockfolio","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blockfolio.blockfolio&hl=en&gl=au"}
