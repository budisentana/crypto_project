I am 100% sure what it should be because I used a password storage tool plus I printed it when I created the account. Found out when I tried to change settings and my current password is not accepted. Now after months for no reason my IP is blocked. Lucky me I didn't store a lot bitcoin. Looks like Scam to me","This once was a great app with great support but now support is non-existent! It has been two weeks and four requests with not even a auto-reply. I will change my review if support contacts me. I have all my recover data but the recover page they give you has bugs and the help page is blocked by Cloud Fire!","Don't use this app, today is may 14,2021, I have deposited 100$ BCH in this wallet some months ago, I changed my phone and reinstalled this app and tried to open my wallet but it's showing my ip address is blocked, I don't know why I mailed to the support team tii now no reply and not opened my wallet. I think these frauds have stolen my funds, so I request you all to transfer your balances to a reliable other wallets as early as possible. This I am writing is real thing happened in my life....","Horrible Wallet. Very hard to send and receive if you plan on keeping low amounts of coins in it. Support is almost non-existent. STAY AWAY!!","Guys Chill.. It's NOT a scam!!! I used to employ this app for couple of years with no problem, but today I encountered the \"loading\" phrase that go on and on and on.. So i come and read almost all reviews, and almost got a heart attack! Bc I kept couple of BTCs for my friend, and he wanted them back.. So after all awful reviews, I thought mine is gone too! But i remembered i used to close and open app couple oftimes till login successfully.
