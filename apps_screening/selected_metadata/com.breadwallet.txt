","comments":["It was decent to use but the lack of backing up your info apart from having to manually record a 12word recovery phrase is so annoying and needs to be addressed in this modern day where everything is stored on our phones. Edit: I know that it's secure - too secure! My office got broken into and all my paperwork destroyed. Making excuses oppose to listening to those who use your app is just poor customer service and am now reducing my rating to 1 because of that.","My experience has been so good, i felt i needed to write a review for others who need a good wallet and cant decide based on others feedback. The app is so user friendly. Is very easy on the eyes. Is super quick. Ive downloaded close to 15 other wallet apps and with BRD i transferred in some BCH (bitcoin cash) the transfers were lightening speed. Literally in split seconds. And network fees $0.00. Wallet fees? $0.00. Yes it cost me absolutely nothing to send BCH in split seconds. I love it 5/5.","I tested this app when it first came out some years ago. Back then it was by far one of the best wallets available and it still is! Security is strong and it has a host of useful features such as the ability to import encrypted private keys from paper wallets you may have cold storage. It also allows you to sweep both BTC and bitcoin cash from wallets created pra to any forks. Don't be put off by some of the negative reviews, if you read them you will find most of them are unreasonable.","Pretty good app for the most part but sometimes you will get an error message when trying to trade between cryptos and it only give a error code and does not tell you what went wrong. Most of the ti.e it is because the app doesn't want you to transfer all of your coin to another coin. For ie. If I have $500 in BTC and want to put that all into ETH I will get an error code. Now if I leave $20 in my BTC and transfer the rest it works pretty good. Buy BRD coin you will save money in trading coin.","Horrible app for your crypto wallet. As soon as my last few transactions clear I am uninstalling. I have been using this app for over a year now and it has literally got worse over time. Transactions take forever for no reason. Overcharge for everything. Trust me...find another wallet. You'll thank me later"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.breadwallet","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.breadwallet&hl=en&gl=au"}
