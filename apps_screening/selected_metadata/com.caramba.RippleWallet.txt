I went through a bunch of issues, uninstalled, reinstalled and ultimately lost my wallet because I was unable to recover my original wallet. I reached out to their customer service and they were very patient helpful in helping me recover my account. We went through many back and forth emails to resolve this and now I have my XRP back. The app works well, but the customer service makes it spectacular. 5 STARS","Disaster. Can't open my account for 6 days now . I have uninstaled reinstalled and no good . I have lost out on a big deal because of this . When the problem is resolved I will be moving my wallet elsewhere.","Worked well since I bought it. Now I can't open the app, keeps crashing. Worst of all is I don't know what happened to My XRP.","UPDATE: 5 stars - Now the best ripple wallet in existence!! No fees and theyre looking into adding feature to convert your transaction history into a csv file for tax season. (Btw if removing fees then you could just add a \"Donate 1% to dev\" button right next to final send transaction button that way reminds them to donate voluntarily and isn't hidden so win/win)"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.caramba.RippleWallet","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.caramba.RippleWallet&hl=en&gl=au"}
