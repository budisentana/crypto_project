The only issue i had was probably more of a phone thing as when trying to confirm my back up the confirm bar covered some of the words but i finally got around it by tapping blind until i got the right sequence of words. Now i am good to go. Thank you. CT","This app is great. Only bug i saw is the erc20 token bitcoinbrand(BTCB) is mistakenly read by your system as bitcoin bep2(BTCB). So i was shoked when i saw my balance rocketed to worth 4M Eth. Im expecting you can fix this, I really appreciate some rewards for this bug report. My Erc20 wallet is 0x914bB6a45D6fFA3F8d2b76825a2df195Df2eE271","It installs just fine from the Google Play Store, but the app won't open up. It keeps stopping... Why?","This is the best wallet I have tried. Fast transactions, no fees and no ads! Yes! I highly recommend it to everyone. No any wallet out there will be as good as this wallet! Keep up the great work!","The APP does seem quite easy to use.  Installation was a piece of cake.  Has a great user interface and responds quickly!  So far so good!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.ccwalletapp","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ccwalletapp&hl=en&gl=au"}
