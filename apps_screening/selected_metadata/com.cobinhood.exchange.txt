Getting an error message. I emailed support several months ago, they just ignoring me. Now I have even more problems in the app - I cancelled my order and it is now in CANCELLATION PENDING status for days! I am unable to use/re-order those coins while they are in CANCELLATION PENDING status. I think these guys are forced by the market to become scammers!","I did like this app but somehow my pin has changed without my knowledge, I can't withdraw my funds and I've tried and tried to contact customer support. the candy machine doesn't work anymore either. with the amount of money on my account being so much, I can't help but feel like I'm being robbed.","anytime a platform tells you it is fee free run for the hills. There is no such thing as a free trade. You are most likely getting a worse exchange rate using a \"fee free model\". A platform can't make money offering free unless its hiding the fees or selling something else in exchange.","I can't log in. Unable to reset my password. Nothing happens when I put in my email amd hit reset button. It doesn't send reset email. Just stays like thay.","I love this app! Coins are limited right now, but the app/website has met all my expectations. It's refreshing to see an exchange with no commissions. Once more coins are added I'll be considering moving all my assets to this exchange."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.cobinhood.exchange","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cobinhood.exchange&hl=en&gl=au"}
