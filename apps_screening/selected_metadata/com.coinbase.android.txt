Looks all good until try to verify the account which is almost impossible. Support is nowhere to be found, refusing to answer emails","So far so good however some problems. Fees are very high with no customer service there is no contact or speak to anyone","Australians... don't use this app. They say you can transfer your funds to another exchange if you want to pull it out but there is no options anywhere in the interface to do so. Support tickets return copied and pasted information for the Support page that doesn't help. I'll be reporting to AFCA if they don't resolve my current ticket. If you experience this I suggest you do too.","Great for beginners. Charts aren't complicated, and your portfolio is easy to look into. Easiest UI for dipping your toes into the crypto pool. Check if the currency you're interested in is available before going ahead if you're set on what you want to trade in, as there are other marketplaces that cover the newer or more volatile currencies.","Disappointed! I wanted to create an account with this app but it keeps on denying my email address saying another user has already registered with it, I changed to 3 different email addresses yet it keeps saying the same thing and this is the first time I'm installing the app on my phone. For this nonsense reason, I couldn't create the account and I felt like the app doesn't want me to use it, I don't know what else to do.... I'm disappointed!!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.coinbase.android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coinbase.android&hl=en&gl=au"}
