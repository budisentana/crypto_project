Got locked out of account. Emailed customer service, no phone number. Account not recognised, you have email from the account you registered with, my header says googlemail (and has a full stop in the middle) instead of gmail they wont accept it. Even though i emailed explained several times that i and had even saved a backup email on the account that matches. The email address that i send from does not match. I am stuck and frustrated, not a pleasant feeling. Please advise.","Beware this company misleads its users by claiming they charge no fees for trading. They charge a hefty fee and it's impossible to find out how they calculate the charges. Their math doesn't match the rules taught at schools and their shameless claims that they don't charge for trading is a scam. Even after complaining to support they act as if it was in my interest to be charged hidden charges. The app and their website are buggy. They should not be allowed to take people's money.","Can't login for last two days !!!","Resolved issue by uninstalling and resetting password through app. Customer service could not help as outgoing email header was different as it shows googlemail instead of gmail and therefore didnt match. Scary experience as you can get locked out of the account with no access to funds. Be careful, high fees unless you buy bitcoin and transfer to external wallet. Good interface when it works terrifying when it does not. Be lucky.","THINK TWICE BEFORE PUTTING YOUR MONEY INTO THIS PLATFORM. They might advertise no trade fees but as they work on averages this means you never receive what you actually pay for. The math Is always incorrect after factoring network fees and coinburp fees. £300 after a 10% raise in 24 hours is not £289 🤬. The android app is buggy and you need to login 8 times a day, and it's a nightmare battle with support to withdraw any funds. Overall my worst experience with a crypto platform in 10+ years."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.coinburp.mobile","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coinburp.mobile&hl=en&gl=au"}
