Easy to use. Easy to deposit and withdraw. Nice way to buy Bitcoin and alternative coins. We highly recommend Coincorner to all. H.I.H.","CoinCorner itself seems like a good service, with quick verification but this app unusable. After around 10 secs after authenticating the app will crash l.","Terrible. Charge about 3 different fee's resulting in only getting about half your money. Will let you sign up and deposit funds and then lock your account untill they verify you. BUT WONT VERIFY YOU! Never sent me the code to very my phone number. After contacting by email and sending them my details to verify STILL NOTHING! ALL JUST A BIG SCAM TO STEAL YOUR MONEY. Look at other reviews!","By far the worst coin buy and seller fees are ridiculous highest I have seen out there i use another app there fees are like between 30/50 pence per transaction this place charges almost 4/5 pounds!!! Seriously and its also 1.65 to change the currency so if you deposit say 10 pounds it would cost 65p to do so then another 1.65 to change to a different currency then another 4 pound odd to send a payment out are they for real!!! Highly dont reccomend go elsewhere you will save a fortune!","This is honestly the worst huge rip off I have ever had and I'm very experienced in the crypto world. I just deposited £38 pounds and by the time I simply converted to Bitcoin and sent it, over £12 had been taken from it and it does it every time with this being the minimum. Seriously, I believe it may be breaking the law and am investigating it now"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.coincorner.app.crypt","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coincorner.app.crypt&hl=en&gl=au"}
