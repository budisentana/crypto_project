No phone number where we can talk and explain our problem. I have a position of a stock waiting and the app crashed. Ant they give us a ticket 🎟 when we need instant support to solve the problem . Who will. Pay for the losses we suffered due to the app not working.","The customer support is awful. Had deposited INR but it hasn't reflected in my coindcx account yet. Raised request tickets, dropped mails, sent bank statements - no response. And I've been patient, this happened on the 29th of May. I'm not even sure what the situation is as there is no response. Ticket number: 499777 Issue still not resolved. It's been over a month.","App is Good but there is some serious problem in this app during login time. This issue was solved in last update when My OS was Android 10 but After updating my phone to Android 11 this issue coming again. It's humble request to developers Please update the app ASAP. It's very important. Take this issue seriously. Waiting for the nxt update.","Brilliant app. Worst customer service! I have constantly asked for updates regarding BNB wallet maintenance for the past 6 days but all I receive is a templated response. This app is restricting movment of tokens and forcing users to buy from what's available on their exchange during the dip. The fees charged are not transparent either. The price on the charts here is always higher than other exchanges. I have no clue how this app has 4.5 rating on playstore. Could be bots!!","App is good but missing important features like there no way to save your indicators. It reset everytime. I have to add indicators manually. Very bad. Also even after cancelled margin order, it shows error can not cancelled and show as active potion and actually cancelled in background. I loss multiple times due to this issue. Very bad sync issue. When you switch from one currency to another, order book will show you right prize but the chart show older crypto chart which is very bad experience"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.coindcx","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coindcx&hl=en&gl=au"}
