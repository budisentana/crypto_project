Unfortunately this is not one of them. Me and many others lost a large amount of money when Coinfalcon decided to unlist IOTA and only send one mail barely 16 hours before on a Sunday. If you want the whole story search for Coinfalcon but replace falcon with failcon. Be safe guys, and please stay away.","Barely getting through start up, adding payment & I.D verication; Poor lighting issue affected the photo & as I went to adjust light it continued automatically. Now it just says Unable to verify id, verification denied & won't let me retake photos or add a bank/card no matter what I do. Force Stopped the app, Deleted & reinstalled the app, wiped all app data & storage to log in & start from scratch; no use. SUPER LAME ðŸ‘Ž","Fantastic way to buy bitcoin with credit card and other cryptocurrencies. These guys have been around for a long time and I've never had any issues, security is pretty top notch and support is pretty responsive. The app is quite new thus it has some things to improve but it's by far the best way to buy crypto on the play store. One thing to mention is the ID verification is basically instant. I tried multiple times to verify on Coinbase but it never worked. CoinFalcon did it perfectly.","Thank you for providing the transaction ID of the deposit you are looking for. The reason why you are not receiving this deposit is that it came from a \"contract address\" and \"we don't accept deposits from contract addresses\" . As for this one deposit, I will ask our devs help if we can manually add it to your account but I can't promise anything. I will update you as soon as we receive an update from our team. If this is the case why isn't this public information before this app is downloaded?","Really great app. Smooth and better user experience. Like the credit feature to buy cryptocurrency. Keep up the good work."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.coinfalcon.mobile","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coinfalcon.mobile&hl=en&gl=au"}
