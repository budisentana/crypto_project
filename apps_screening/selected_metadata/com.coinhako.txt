With the amount of people using, loading should have been manually adjusted to accommodate. If you guys are saving costs on server loadings, you'll keep facing this issue often. Reallocation of loading could be costly,but that's up to your engineers to think of an alternative solution. Another issue is your buy price is always higher and sell price is lower on checkout, big turnoff! Jiayou Coinhako!","1) Long processing time for deposits, not like what they promised (Daily 10am and 4pm). It could take many days. 2) Cant login every now and then, it just hangs there. 3) Always push a message saying login to get 2x rewards but it's not rewarding you when you logged in. 4) Pretty bad.","Slow in refund. When deopsit using different account failed to acknowledge. Emailed to the support team. Where they acknowledged the fund tramsfer was make but they cannot credit into trading account. They needed 60 days to process. But after 60 days no news on the refund....","You need to fall in order to rise, this is a great app if you are too rich and don't know where to spend your money. This app boasts its high transaction rate and it also allows you to leech 20% of your friends transaction fee, so if you have any nemesis or frenemy, this app is the right choice for you. I could probably have a holiday for months of luxurious spending on the amount of money i lose in the transaction fee. Highly recommended","Lag at peak hours. One of the price is not even moving and cant transact at crucial timing. Selling is always lower than buying"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.coinhako","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coinhako&hl=en&gl=au"}
