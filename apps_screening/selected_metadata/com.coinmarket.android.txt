Powerful and detailed, lots of good information, manual entry(!), it's impressive! But it's hard to use. I get lost in the underground rabbit tunnels and can't find my way back. I love that it shows price per coin, quantity bought, and purchase price. I've been looking for an app that does that for, like, forever! I've finally found the holy grail! But it's not elegant or simple. Do we really need 8 zeroes after the decimal point? It's so hard to read. Don't have the❤️to uninstall.","It won't allow me to create a portfolio, because i have no passcode on my device!? What the hell? Im deleting the app","Great App with multiple features. Good way to keep all your account balances using the portfolio tab. Good work guys.","Useful tool for tracking crypto, simple to use and I think you should ➕ dark theme for those who are like.","Great for tracking coins, beautiful widget!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.coinmarket.android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coinmarket.android&hl=en&gl=au"}
