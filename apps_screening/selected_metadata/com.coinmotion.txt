I expect a bit more from an app where I handle substantial amount of my money. Seriously considering moving to another service","Positive: easier euro transfers, excellent support, and fast. Negative: sales fee 2% is hidden when buying, fees are high compared to Binance.","Super fast and smooth access to my Coinmotion account. Still missing a few of the desktop features, but I've understood from their support that they are introducing these gradually.","So far very good experience.
