Haven't done my transaction yet but I hope it will do well. I can custom transaction fee myself and keep it as low as 1satoshi/byte. Mycelium Wallet also allows this feature however this wallet seems more handy.","The best crypto wallet out there. My only criticism is the UI which isn't bad, I just think it's a bit dated. Also they're support team is amazing. They're active replying to user's questions and complaints (which are mostly user's fault and not the app's).","It's a little tricky to understand at first but I've used it over 2 years now. Definitely a good wallet once you understand how to use it. Feels a bit more secure than others, and there's an easy to access coin exchange within the app itself.","A great wallet that handles a wide variety of coins. Yet to have a single glitch. Works great on my Android tablet. Heartily Recommend.","Looks good, but your transaction fees are high for small transactions. Please come up with a better solution. Also why must all transaction fees be in ETH?"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.coinomi.wallet","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coinomi.wallet&hl=en&gl=au"}
