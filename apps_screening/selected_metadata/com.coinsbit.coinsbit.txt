I bought specifically MAYP on the 27/4/21, when the market price was 2.387857 BTC. The problem with the website, is it does not show you how much you will received before you press confirm. So I unfortunately trusted the system, and when I clicked purchase, I then received half the amount i expected. I found on my receipt that they paid out at market value 5.0 BTC. The big issues is, their customer support is comparable to a brick wall. Since this transaction, I have been in contact with their customer support via email, we have had about 25 emails back and forth, and so far every response I get is: \"Dear user, good day. Sorry for the delay. Your issue will be considered and fixed. It may take some time, but don't worry! there will be a resolution.\" It's been over a month and they haven't once mentioned anything this consequential glitch, and I don't think they will. Don't lose your money like me. And to coinsbit, please don't respond to this message saying 'please contact us' like you did last time, as I did what you said, and that has gone nowhere. My ticket number is #86624, that's where you can help me","Never got my email confirmation number"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.coinsbit.coinsbit","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coinsbit.coinsbit&hl=en&gl=au"}
