Its interface is easy to use. Great for beginners. I hope they add more coins in the future. Watch out when using the exchange. They won't return your tokens after cancellation. Beware.","Simple, clean, and source available. Beware, though. They claim only the minimum blockchain fees are assessed but the build distributed here charges multiple doge, sometimes tens or even hundreds, when Dogecoin famously only requires 1 doge for even large transactions. Where are these extra doge going? Are they going somewhere or are users simply forced to overpay? No option to edit fee. Strangely, it seems honest and correct for other coins. I use the langerhans wallet for Dogecoin anyway but it's frustrating because I'd like to recommend this one for general multi-coin use.","Says it converts DOGE, then doesn't let you. Transferred crypto over to it and now wasted a fee to do that and going to get charged for going somewhere else. This is a waste of your time, find another app, another site, anywhere that you can that will let you convert what you want to. Seems pretty dodgy to advertise something and then not do anything that you've said. The app is easy enough to use, and that's the only reason for not giving a 1, simple and basic, nothing to say there, but definitely not worth your time for trading.","Great app just having trouble getting a old account back as I don't know of the log in","Charged me a $10 fee for buying $30 of Bitcoin, then only alaws me to send half of what I put in. DONT GET THIS. I can't find any support email to reach out to them. I just lost $40."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.coinspace.app","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coinspace.app&hl=en&gl=au"}
