Because the gain and lose indicator in your wallet, does not reflect what you already invested. Plus, how about putting... My Open Stop Loss / Take Profit Orders.. On the app","Can you please fix the front screen when the app loads. After the login screen loads it gets redrawn a second time moving the email, password and login button upwards. So while you're typing or if you click in the password field I keep hitting the login button because it's moved to the position where the password field was and login fails. Very annoying because it happens every time the app loads.","This is the best app to use if need to transfer BITCOIN to AUD then into BANK ACCOUNT and so easy to do so. Took me not even 2 minutes to set up. Cost to transfer Bitcoin to AUD was nothing!! and only takes 1 business day to go through, same day if deposit before 2oclock. Once again I'll say its \" AWESOME\". If there were ads they didn't annoy me as I didn't see them.","No night mode. Quick, easy, simple to do. Half of us use dark mode on our phones. Thus is the only app on my phone that does not offer a dark theme, and I've got hundreds. I'll stick to the browser interface until you get it fixed. Thanks, Steve.","Easy to use for beginners. It's too expensive for the fee (0.1% charge is a lie, always over 1% or much more for tradings). It charges me somewhere over 10% near the highest or lowest points when you are possible to make money. Also the exchange rate is not following the bank guidelines. This app was designed for making your money rather than help you to make money."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.coinspot.app","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coinspot.app&hl=en&gl=au"}
