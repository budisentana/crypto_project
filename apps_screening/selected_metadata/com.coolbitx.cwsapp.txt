Have contacted customer support on many occasions only to get a \" buy a new $100 card\" as a response. Some of us construction workers don't want to buy a new $100 every other month just to manage our finances. Stick with Coinbase it's much easier.","This is basicly a software wallet, but i don't know why it does not support alots of coins? Specially the ones with TRC20 network for transfer which all the other software wallets such as atomic and trust have them! Using only ERC20 network is only for people with a lot of money not the ones with low money because the fee is too much. Sorry for 4 star but adding more coins with more networks will easily make it 5 star ⭐⭐⭐","I love it! But check the list of tokens the wallet holds before you get it. But it works fine for me had it almost a year no issues. I would recommend to anyone","No place in the menu for 'manage stakes' which is concerning but the card and app have been very effective for me besides that.","Update. Coolbitx did respond quickly to my concern on the lack of tax csv or some downloadable assistance to extract tax info. As it is, taxes are the worse with it. Otherwise I've been happy with the cool wallet. We'll see if anything happens."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.coolbitx.cwsapp","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coolbitx.cwsapp&hl=en&gl=au"}
