Best crypto widgets (come with the app). The only feature I wish for would be a year long chart widget. I know this sounds unnecessary because yesterday's year-long chart will be similar to today's and tomorrow's, and because many people have a mental image of the last year. However, for myself, it's easy to forget exactly when things happened 8 or 9 months ago, & that's important for seasonal trends. I can look it up, & just remember, but I end up w/ a static image in mind.","Love this app! It's super user friendly and clean, and has handy widgets, recommending to my friends. Only thing I'd add is on the Portfolio page, a comparison with how much was spent too buy that coin, for easy comparison with its current price","I mainly use the app for the widgets on my homescreen, to get a quick look. This used to work like a charm. Now the widgets don't update anymore for like a week already. Fix this and you'll get 5 stars.","An amazing app for both news and keeping up with crypto prices. The choice of alarm settings are great and the widgets that come along with the app are useful too. Highly advise buying the pro version. You get what you pay for with it.","It was a good app a while ago...from last few weeks when i open it keep loading and loading then crashing. Not happy with it anymore. After reinstalled everything works perfect :)))"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.crypter.cryptocyrrency","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.crypter.cryptocyrrency&hl=en&gl=au"}
