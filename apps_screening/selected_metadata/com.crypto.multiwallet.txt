Also 5 stars","Fantastic wallet. Secure and easy to use. Customer service is excellent too.","Was pleased with security and ease with which I was able to setup an account and deposit funds. App seems stable and we'll designed. Was initially rating at one star because for almost a day a transaction seemed to be lost... Like most other companies it appears that they just don't have enough customer support staff to communicate quickly with customers, but all is well now.","My first crypto app. Seems to work well. Have yet to try and withdraw from my account yet, but as far as trading and buying, it functions well. There does seem to be some lag between the current price and the buy price. It will show one price, but the buy price is different when u do the exchange. Not sure what fees there are, because it doesn't break down what went where. Just a congrats, your transaction worked. But it doesn't always work..."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.crypto.multiwallet","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.crypto.multiwallet&hl=en&gl=au"}
