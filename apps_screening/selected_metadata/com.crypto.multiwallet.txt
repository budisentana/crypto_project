The customer support alone has been such a help with questions ive had about the wallet and even about currencies. They respond within minutes and are eager to help until you are satisfied. The format of the wallet is very simple and easy to use. I highly recommend this wallet.","Simply elegant and a pleasure to use. Wish we had more options to other types if coins. Good luck team! You're flawless my beloved wallet ;), thanks for the reply. Update 4 July 2021, love it. All the best to the Guardarians from BKK!!!","VERY user friendly wallet for most major crypto assets/tokens. Easy wallet/currency-based imports, secured non custodial system, tons of staking support & legit 💻/📱 parity. 3rd party \"best price\" system for fiat buys. Real cust-svc & good crypto pricing/info included + many other features like ledger-only support, multiple currency/wallet addresses, integrated DEX-based asset exchange, etc. After using Exodus 🙈 forever for it's desktop app, just 😡 for not finding Guarda sooner! 🤑","Enjoyed staking in the desktop wallet version. Unfortunately, there is no Algorand in the mobile app and that's a big letdown..","This is the best cryptowallet i have ever used. I have been using it for more than 3 months now and i love it very much. I really appreciate the developer for making such a great application.
