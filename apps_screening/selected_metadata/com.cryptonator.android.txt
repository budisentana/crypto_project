I tried it at 2020 and it was all good at that time but now it is getting worse. They take 10 doge as a fee for transfer . Well as u can see 1 doge on other platforms. So as my experience this the worst app ever i have used . Its so worst that when i tried to transfer my dogecoin from cryptonator at the time when the fee was 1 doge it never happened. They failed my transfer every time and now they have just increase the doge fee.","Was working great at first but once dogecoin shot up it started having serious issues, it's been down for a month and tons of us are still waiting on a reply from you guys, your support isn't doing any supporting at all cause no one has gotten any answers, we're all left in the blind here, sooner or later you guys will have to answer for what you're doing.","I've used cryptonator for years but not sure what's going on lately. Like others here have mentioned. I tried moving my dogecoin to another wallet and the transaction is stuck on pending. It's almost a month now and there's no response to emails because there's no other option to reach them.","Dogecoin went \"offline\" for two weeks, meaning you were unable to access your crypto, so no sending or trading. Completely ridiculous. 100% Scam Service. The value of the coin cut in half in that time. Cryptonator is NOT regulated and charges exorbitant fees. Use Binance or Coinbase instead.","Great wallet! I've had this for a few years now and it was always a pan if you hadn't logged in for a while as i had to for my computer up and re-autherise my device. They have sorted that now and the wallet is one of the best looking and easiest to use 5*"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.cryptonator.android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cryptonator.android&hl=en&gl=au"}
