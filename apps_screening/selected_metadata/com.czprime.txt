Can't login when l want.","They put 30 day holds on ach deposits so you can't actually spend usd with their card. I was going to get a black card with Coinzoom. Until I noticed that you're charged $0.30 every time you use the card. That means small purchases would lose you money and that overall cashback is going to be much lower than expected. If the silly fee is ever removed I'd recommend it.","Its great as long as you follow each step perfectly. üëç Rewards are great with use of the visa card.","Good, though UI has some rough points. Examples: 1) Can't set timezones (so shows UTC/GMT), 2) Charts are hard to scroll with your finger.","Apparently they dont want money invested into their exchange. I've finished the KYC process however the customer support is non-existant as its been 6 buisness days and still no response on my account. Ive opened up a support ticket and only response i got was \"Hey we are busy and it will take awhile to get to you\". I paraphrased but you get the point."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.czprime","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.czprime&hl=en&gl=au"}
