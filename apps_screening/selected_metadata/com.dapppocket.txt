Going on for over 2 months now. Same issue. Did the reporting with Google and everything.","Unfortunately i lost my phone but when i got new phone and i entered my 12 phrase words i can't find my 810 tron coins again. This is just annoying, I want my coins back and if i didn't get it back, I will tell all my families, friends and even broadcast it on social media for the world to know about ur poor performance app.","When i try to send my crypto, screen goes blank. Worst experience :-(","Great app. The only problem im having is every dapp app I use has FST(TRC20) on their token list. This one seems to be the only one without one. Please add it because i currently stake this coin and would love to be able to hold it here. If you guys do that, this would be a 5 star app.","This is truly one of the best Crypto Wallets out right now, I have tried and used most all of them. Crazy this only has 1000 downloads and my favorite and with a few cool features this wallet does not have is the FLASH coin wallet"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.dapppocket","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dapppocket&hl=en&gl=au"}
