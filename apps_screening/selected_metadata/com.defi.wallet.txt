In this update:<br>- Minor bug fixes &amp; UI improvements","comments":["I haven't had an issue with the app and am enjoying a tidy return on crypto stored in the wallet. About the only thing I dislike is the 28 day unbonding, I understand why it's done but I think you'd get the same result setting it to 14 days. Most of the 1 star comments here are from people who have no understanding of gas fees or what DeFi is actually for.","Nothing but excellent things to say about this app and the team behind it. The user interface is extremely easy to get the hang of, and everything is very fast to transfer. The best part of it all, you yourself own your seed phrase. If an app doesn't offer this, your crypto assets are ultimately at risk. Love this DeFi wallet, DeFi is the way of the future! Get rid of the monopoly governments and banks have over your money.","70 USD just disappeared trying to use the swap function....no one has answered any email I've sent. Tried this out because I heard the fees were cheaper than coinbase, which is true, however MIGHT WANNA MAKE SURE YOUR DEFI SWAP FUNCTION WORKS before touting lower fees!!!! Just sayin.... Thank the block chain gods i didn't dump my whole portfolio into this pos app. Also had terrible bugs...can't see any prices at all.... Terrible app...stay away!","After the last update, the app stopped working. When launched, only text labels are displayed. No account balances or other functionality is available 👎","They updated the app and I needed my backup file to access the money I invested. When I saw that they recommended the backup, I immediately followed through and uploaded the file to my Google Drive. When I went for it just now, the file turned out to be empty. It has a file size of 0 bytes. Surprise! Without the blatant robbery, this app would be passable. If you intend to use this app, definitely write down your backup on paper."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.defi.wallet","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.defi.wallet&hl=en&gl=au"}
