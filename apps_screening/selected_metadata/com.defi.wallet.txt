They fail to tell you that you can only place market orders if you live in the United States. And when you contact them about it they state that they're working hard to make it available to everyone else but offered absolutely no resolution when I brought up the fact that it wasn't stated per Google play bylaws and they were in breach of their contract. There was still no resolution so we'll be looking into it. Till the I recommend an honest brokerage.","I'm furious. I deposited $100 I to bitcoin on the 29th only so I could convert it to another crypto & not only am I losing money by the minute but the app will not allow me to log on. Not once. So I can't finish what I started or even get my $ back. Someone needs to fix this before I post on all of my media pages including the investment group I admit & have them leave bad reviews. I've reached out for days $ NOTHING! I want immediate help & my money returned as it was deposited in full.","So far I've not had an issue and hope it continues to be an amazing app! ALWAYS LEVELING UP and being ahead of the rest! Love n gratitude! Keep SHIBA INU and XRP rocking! Hope that XRP(Ripple) will be back on this! Plus wondering about the coins from the snapshot from December with XRP. Do you know when we will be receiving our Spark coins?","I'm finding it incredibly irritating that I transferred some USDC (which wasn't what I meant to buy, I just wanted USD. Very confusing that there is USD & USDC) so now I've got 130$ tied up & stuck in the wallet until I can manage to buy enough Ethereum to be able to pay the transaction fee that can only be paid for in Ethereum. Which is like 30$ worth because thats minimum amount I'm allowed to withdraw on the app. Very annoyed. 30$ just so I can withdraw my money?!? Crazy .....","They should let you view your password to make sure you typed it in correctly I know what I typed in but it refuses to confirm five failed attempts but I had no way of making sure it was typed correctly this sucks I'm going to try another app. I don't understand how confirmation that you typed the right numbers or letters this is simply feedback that you're putting in what you want to please explain how that is somehow jeopardizing security. please explain the reasoning"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.defi.wallet","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.defi.wallet&hl=en&gl=au"}
