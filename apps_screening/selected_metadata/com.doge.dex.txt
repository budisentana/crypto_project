Past month, it no longer shows FIAT value. Selecting currency in settings doesn't work. No list loads when tapping the setting anymore. Creating new orders doesn't work either. Initially trying to perform an exchange also doesn't immediately show open orders anymore. Now you need to wait a while and there is no feedback indicating loading. No ability to generate new deposit addresses is also kind of annoying. Has promise, but needs work in several areas.","Honest experience, love the platform. BE CAREFUL, being that this is essentially p2p swaps, people can set their own price, READ before submitting any trade. Have had no issues with getting funds in and out.","I successfully created an account with the windows version, had my seed phrases correct, just signed out. Trying to login has been full of hassles even with a good network connection. Over an hour I'm yet to login.","I connected DogeDEX with the atomicDEX desktop client. The app itself is pretty good and simple. The desktop app is a bit more advanced. They connect seemless to each other, and the transactions are pretty darn quick.
