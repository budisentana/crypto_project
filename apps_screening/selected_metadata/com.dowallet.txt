I was charged $17 for sending $150 to my other coinbase wallet. Coinbase and Blockchain don't charge more than $2 for this amount of transaction. They are greedy and mean. Thank God I now know how much high their transaction fee is. I have discontinued using them.","42+ hours now I've been waiting for a send to confirm. Customer service said they had charged too low of fees and miners were refusing to process it. I was told they fixed the fees so this wouldn't happen again. Well I sent another one 11+ hours ago, paid for the faster transaction and left a tip. Guess what! It hasn't confirmed either. So they fixed nothing and lied straight up to me. Screw these guys. Don't waste your money or time on their BS.","Was all going well until I gad a problem with my pass-phrase. I contacted customer services via email and no one has responded to my message (two week+ now). Would recommend you try another app with better customer service reviews.","I used to like this wallet, but the fees are too high. $57.00 transaction fee to send crypto is a robbery.","Excellent and easy to use, start small"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.dowallet","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dowallet&hl=en&gl=au"}
