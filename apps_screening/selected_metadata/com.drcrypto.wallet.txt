I transfered 150 dollars to the wallet and it only shows as 0.12. The representative which is impossible to get a hold of and barely responds saw in the transaction and said they will be get back to me. It's been over a week waiting for them to get back to me after trying 3 weeks to get a response. Don't download this app. It's a scam. Update. I tried sending the .12 out from their wallet to a different but just disssapeared","These 5 star reviews seem fake. I can't move BTC out of the wallet. The app crashes on any initiated transaction. Support is NOT fast. I have been waiting several hours for a response to this issue and not even an acknowledgement so far. Beware this scam!","DO NOT SEND UR CRYPTO TO THIS PLAYFORM!!!!! Scam... About 50% of crypto requires a memo in order to receive funds from another platform. This app does not give you that option. So once your crypto currency is in here it's stuck here or you lose it forever!!!","I used bitsmart to send Doge. But it disappeared. They don't have contact for complain.","Scam app. Stay away from this if you want to keep your money. You can deposit funds fine but if you try to withdraw it vanishes and support is worthless."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.drcrypto.wallet","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.drcrypto.wallet&hl=en&gl=au"}
