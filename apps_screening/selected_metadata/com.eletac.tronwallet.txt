Now I'm trying to input the recovery phrase and it is saying incorrect phrase. What is yge solution to this","Be extremely careful of this app people, these people are conmen. It's called Vision App for a good reason.. First off.. Try uninstalling the app then re-installing, you should be given a new seed phrase of course, nope.. Stays the same each time, meaning, a ton of others ALSO have YOUR seed phrase and will undoubtedly be enjoying your assets very soon. Second... There's the \"Add and receive funds\" function which actually allows you to fake money in your account.. Think about this..","I would give 5 stars but there's a couple things I need fixed. First swap prices dont show and second the swap exchange lags some days and dont allow swapping. Overall for a beta app this is pretty good. I'm able to swap for certain coins that other apps dont support. Plus the free daily vision rewards are sweet.","Vision is one of the best web wallets so far. But POLONIDEX exchange linked inside the Vision wallet isn't safe and too risky until VISION has wallets that support every Coin on the Tron exchange of POLONIDEX. During the market crash POLONIDEX Disabled withdrawals and selling of Crypto and then shut down their site leaving VISION wallet users with total loss of assets on POLONIDEX. I loss $. Vision needs more wallets that protect users from these situations. Please update with new features.","This is a fraud app in the starting he give daily vision reward but after days he did not giving still pending my reward after app say below ypur minimum balance but ihave 10$ btc in my vision wallet"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.eletac.tronwallet","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eletac.tronwallet&hl=en&gl=au"}
