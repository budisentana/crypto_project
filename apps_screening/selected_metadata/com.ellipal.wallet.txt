But stETH token which is popular among eth2 staker is not listed while shitcoin like shiba coin is! Cant be more dissapointed. No support for native segwit address. Would have given 5 stars.","Just got the App since I got Titan Cold Wallet. I notice when I'm using a VPN; TorGuard. I can't connect to Binance DEX and DApp. Update: June 28, 2021 I should have mentioned... TrustWallet App works fine with my VPN.","Cold Wallet Realy Cool, Service on Point. But theres no dark mode. In Trx wallet i only see the balance ofntrx not btt or other coin. Not a lot of Staking for coin. And realy realy realy realy long delevery but I love the wallet. Realy worth the price.","I really do like the hardwallet, but the app is quite buggy at times. I mainly use it for long-term storage, but there are those times when you need to make sudden moves. The lack of limit buys or sales make the exchange minimally useful. There are times when sending fails and exchanging does not work. (Polkadot has been stuck in the app for months). All in all, I'm hoping that more thought will be given to the app's functionality. It could be cool, but it's not totally there yet.","I can not add token using contract address. It doesn't show anything. I'm using this wallet specially for HECO chain and now it's really useless to me if I can't add HECO tokens."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.ellipal.wallet","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ellipal.wallet&hl=en&gl=au"}
