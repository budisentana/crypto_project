Optimization of some detailsã€‚","comments":["Good app. But so buggy that experience is a miss. The most annoying one are: - even with Lockscreen active, most of the time you can enter the app without biometric auth - While forcing a refresh on the exchange or wallet , it spins for a very long period of time before refreshing anything Please work on the usability of the app.","Good app. I am considering to buy the hardware wallet soon. But stETH token which is popular among eth2 staker is not listed while shitcoin like shiba coin is! Cant be more dissapointed. No support for native segwit address. Would have given 5 stars.","Just got the App since I got Titan Cold Wallet. I notice when I'm using a VPN; TorGuard. I can't connect to Binance DEX and DApp. Update: June 28, 2021 I should have mentioned... TrustWallet App works fine with my VPN.","Easy to use and cool wallet fast transfer but when you deposit, its slow to reflect in wallet. Hope add some recieve and sent notificationsðŸ˜Šgreat wallet but need improvements","I can not add token using contract address. It doesn't show anything. I'm using this wallet specially for HECO chain and now it's really useless to me if I can't add HECO tokens."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.ellipal.wallet","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ellipal.wallet&hl=en&gl=au"}
