When BTC goes down, the app automatically converts BTC to USDC and you can earn APY on USDC. There is also a BTC mining option to get free BTC!!","I love this app I love the fact that you can mine for bitcoins without having to have a supercomputer it is easy it is quick it doesn't use all your battery and it do it in the background best app ever","Highly recommend, great customer service and perfect for any one who wants to benefit from crypto gains without the headache!","I love the ease of use! It makes it easy to find the right fund and also as an investor in the company it was a good choice. Simple enough for people that are not super knowledgeable on Cryptocurrency.","Great app! Makes investing easy. The only thing that's slightly annoying is that when you click on a portfolio in the invest tab, the portfolio details seem to be cut off mid-sentence for some reason."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.emberfund.ember","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.emberfund.ember&hl=en&gl=au"}
