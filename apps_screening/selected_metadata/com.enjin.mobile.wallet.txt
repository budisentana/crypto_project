I use it to store my NFTS on that I use for games such as Forgotten Artifacts and Space Misfits. The QR scanner helps a lot as well in order to transfer NFTS from one address to another in a fast way without writing down the whole address. It's also been easy for me to sell things on the wallet through Enjinx by simply going to my NFT hitting sell on any NFT I want to sell that is in the multiverse. good better best wallet wow wow wow","Update: Significant improvement in speed and exchange fees. Thanks for working on it. Previous: Takes Deposits no problem. The moment you try to withdraw or exchange, endless problems. Part of this rating is their choice of Exchange. Changelly sucks huge. Changelly Dynamic sends tyrannical KYC notices for small transactions where KYC is not legally required. Changelly is trying to falsely obtain people's personal information. Changelly also has unreasonable minimums. Thx","Extremely promt reply. I had gotten a new phone and couldn't figure out how to get into my wallet. They replied immediately and I was able to very easily get into my wallet with their instructions! Took just a minute too.","Wallet and the support team is very friendly service . Easy to use and the features is awesome !","I had some backlog issues that were frustrating me. I was backed up 21 transactions. I submitted a ticket and I received a response with a day from support. I had already solved my issue with someone I found on Discord. But other than that I like the wallet and the dapps. I am new so the backlog thing was probably my fault anyway"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.enjin.mobile.wallet","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.enjin.mobile.wallet&hl=en&gl=au"}
