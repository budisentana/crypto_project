It allows me to deposit crypto just fine but i cant make any purchases at all. All purchases say pending regardless of how high i put the gas frees. I have replaced the transactions with no success. I have tried to reach out to customer service with no real help apart from one friendly email. I have since lost several opportunities to buy priceless ingame NFTs. Very disappointed with the enjin wallet and the whole etherium nft space.","Absolutely love this wallet! All the coins I buy are allowed to be stored here! I like the layout, it's simple, looks good, and works great! Also, it's another wallet that YOU have governance over and you are in charge of your keys! Will be using this wallet for a very long time!","I've had this wallet pretty much since it was first released and it has worked flawlessly. I thought I had a problem recently - some ETH that I had transferred into my wallet were only visible as internal transactions on the blockchain, not as a transaction within the wallet. I contacted support & they explained clearly (& quickly) how things worked & that even though I couldn't see the actual transaction, the balance of the wallet was correct. It's down to the blockchain, not the wallet.","This is one of the best and one of my personal favorite wallets hands down. If some sights didn't require certain others I may just be exclusive to enj. The metaverse is growing, the wallet is more refined and faster than ever, and the integrations including jumpnet are compounding. Not just for enjin but a must if you use their ecosystem!","Great wallet, it's easy and it's secure. I use it to store my NFTS on that I use for games such as Forgotten Artifacts and Space Misfits. The QR scanner helps a lot as well in order to transfer NFTS from one address to another in a fast way without writing down the whole address. It's also been easy for me to sell things on the wallet through Enjinx by simply going to my NFT hitting sell on any NFT I want to sell that is in the multiverse. good better best wallet wow wow wow"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.enjin.mobile.wallet","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.enjin.mobile.wallet&hl=en&gl=au"}
