The app frequently refresh the page where you have to input the credit card details so nothing can be done here most of the time, even if you passed this step, still. Now i was automaticall lockout from my account because of google authenticator, w/c i didn't choose as my two factor authen., i preferred my mobile. Any advice EO? How to recover my account without the google authentication? Or i just have to accept that i lost my account?!","It's confusing to use, finding any wallet address, the focus is just on buying crypto. Logging out by itself, I don't know why. There are many more interesting and safe wallet to choose.","I opened the account and wished to use it right away, topped up only small money first as i didnt trust it due to some reviews. Of course theu were right you need to be verified before you can use your funds or send them . They ask for way too much info even your bank card picture which to me indicated there fraudulent , anyway i uploaded all bur not the bill and whoopie i got rejected . So i was vex, emailed them and requested my money back n close the account n they agreed and issued my refund","ridiculous app when I try to charge my card the payment merchant is not allowing they keep on saying try different card or do bank transfer but the transaction I try to do which is $500 and they know I can't process this via bank transfer when I reach support they were available 24/7 but they were unable to help","buying was easy , but verifying is hard as hell if u use ur virtual card. the live support was good but they were useless if you ask about kyc. the kyc team took almost 2 week to reply to my email. The fee for sending any amount of btc was tooo expensive $10 per transaction!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.eofinance","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eofinance&hl=en&gl=au"}
