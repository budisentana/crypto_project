Another thing, lack of estimate in swap unless fund available. Lack of feature handy feature for app create multiple wallets within same crypto help reduce exposure risk would. Add: A HIGHLY RECOMMENDED wallet use for transactions. All transactions recorded with value lock at the moment executed make P/L book keeping easy.","Do not use!! You can't actually buy or sell anything even after verification, they will accept currency you send then thats it your stuck with in there wallet, can't sell or trade it. Only thing you can do is send to another wallet with a 50% miner fee! Support is useless they avoid all questions and just send bot links to read","This is the worst app I've ever downloaded. I cant get to any of my coins because i have no ether for fee. I cant buy ether because an error message says something went wrong and i cant transfer my coins to ether (usd coin which is ether base coin) because i have no ether for the fee. If you want your money stay away from this site!!!!","The fees are really high.. takes half when you send or transfer. Huge turn off.","amazing app, live graphs if you just wanna idle watch for abit stretches to a year, plenty of cryptos available to play with and customer support is very helpful with questions and whatever \"problem\" or misunderstandings you might have and are quick to put you at ease provided its working hours overall great experience"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.evercoin","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.evercoin&hl=en&gl=au"}
