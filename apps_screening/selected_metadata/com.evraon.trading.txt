{"title":"Evraon - trading for everyone. Crypto and stocks","description":"Have you ever been trading on crypto exchanges or stock exchanges before? I have. My resuts were bad. After months they were worse. Then I got an idea that my results are connected to the app I used for trading. Without a clear understanding of what is happening on a market, it is impossible to trade. And not every app can give to a trader that understanding. That's why I created Evraon. For everyone. \r\n\r\nMy answer on a question of every trader (from a beginner to a pro): \"What application can be as comfortable and effective as possible for trading?\" - this one. And I think you will be insterested in it too and here is why:\r\n\r\n- the app has a bot that can trade by itself with a task you set\r\n- there are a couple of strategies for automatic and manual trading: scalper, flash, highlow\r\n- UI is build for maximum speed and effectiveness: different actions are bonded to one quick click, long click, double click on buttons\r\n- you can add hundreds of exchange's accounts and to switch between them quickly\r\n\r\n- you can connect your phone to another phone, PC or server with installed  Evraon on it. That means all traffic will be going through that server. You can have bad connection with limited traffic like on the islands and there are no problems\r\n- demo mode with any balance in it: learn, test strategies, show off large percentages\r\n- chart, public trades, orderbook, your open orders, prices/stats, placing order's UI - all of it placed on one screen of the phone!\r\n- scalper's order book: long click on order book to place a limit order and double click to place a stop-order\r\n- professional scalper's order book: one click for place an order, double click for place a stop order, swipe for change price and long click for cancel. Also there is a view for market trades in realtime! \r\n\r\n- four variants of a chart: candles, bars, line and trades by seconds in the form of points of different sizes (the volume of each trade is taken into account, very clearly)\r\n- internal wallet for counting your profit & loss per task/instrument. There is a chart for it too. Profit is counted in Bitcoins and USD (all crypto currencies will be converted to them)\r\n- Binance Spot, Binance Futures. Binance Margin, Bitmex, Moscow and Saint-Petersburg exchanges are supported. Yes, margin trading is in your pocket with ability to buy and sell international stocks and futures!\r\n- many UI skins - dark, white, and black for Amoled screens\r\n\r\n- Telegram bot is included. You can \"talk\" with it, see the stats, make changes to the bot's configuration\r\n- notifications about closed orders, important events\r\n- alerts that can be customized to each price you are interested in. Notifications will be sent to your phone and Telegram\r\n- you will be mobile: trade everywhere, not only near you computer. More time to live, to family, to have fun, to travel around the world.\r\n\r\nAnd the most important thing: this app was made by a trader and a developer not just the developer. It means I understand you. Understand what really matters. \r\n\r\nLet's make of you the trader who is always mobile, calm and at the same time motivated for actions!\r\n\r\nDownload the app and we'll continue there.","descriptionHTML":"Have you ever been trading on crypto exchanges or stock exchanges before?
