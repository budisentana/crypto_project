App launched with bugs and inactive pairings. Existing community and support is laughable and you will leak lots of cash trying to figure it out. If you absolutely must, do what i did and experiment with a small amount first. Thank goodness I did as I cant get my test cash out now. 2 stars because nobody believes 1 star reviews.","I love this DEX app. Most of DEX I saw so far are built on ethereum and the trades are limited to erc20 tokens. This one gives the convinence to trade cryptocurrency established in various blockchains and is easy to use. Definitely the version 2 showed more improvement than ver.1. I just hope more major tokens will be added in the next version.","A great bitcoin wallet and multi crypto wallet app. Trading is intuitive and responsive as are peer to peer transactions. If you're looking for a decentralized exchange, open source, and autonomous wallet ownership then i recommend this app."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.exchangily.wallet","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.exchangily.wallet&hl=en&gl=au"}
