","comments":["After i update the app on July the 14 i cant get sign in on the app. ***Update *** After i reboot my phone the app is now fully functional again. Before i didn't have a problem running on the old update, but now my phone runs the update 3.1.0 and it wouldn't connect to the internet, solution restart your phone and you are good to go.","Customer service is \"great\", you open a ticket with an urgent matter and you get a reply, if lucky, 1-2 weeks later. And why? Because they were all busy to make a \"new improved design update\" which is horrible. Why would you take a good simple thing and ruin it? I would give 0 stars if possible.","App is very easy to use and intuitive, but extremely limited in features, the refresh rates are slow, and the fees will take you but surprise. I wouldn't recommend it but it is the app I got started with when I didn't know any better.","Fraudulent. With my first purchase I did not find any info on how high the fee would be. The second purchase said in the preview that there was no fee. Instead it took 4%. Luckily I only tested it with a small sum of money. Reply to the developers reply: At times I had the \"example transaction\" tell me the value of my cryptos after I would buy them. Once I bought them they were sometimes 5-6% lower than the value that was shown, there are only seconds between buying the cryptos and having them.","It's easy to use, but I would like to have an simple interface where I can see the gains etc. Currently you have to calculate stuff like that yourself ðŸ˜• (If there is some hidden page that has this.. let me know)"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.flutter.litebit","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.flutter.litebit&hl=en&gl=au"}
