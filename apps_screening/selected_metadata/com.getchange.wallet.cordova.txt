When you want to sell crypto, app will sell it lower than actual market price. You loose. When you want to set a limit order, it gives you EUR currency, but I want to set in USD! Since I trade BTC/USD, not BTC/EUR! When you buy crypto, app buys it higher than standard market price, possible they create price gap + app takes big commission. Limit orders are very inconvenient and useless.","I deposited some money in the app which Never showed up in the app, nor did they refund me. They did acknowledge receiving the money but did not find my account. I have been constantly emailing them looking for an answer but so far after several days, i have had no answer. Really slow and inefficient customer service . My money is apparently stuck now.","Would be better if it supported deposits and withdrawals with all the currencies it offers and not just 4 or 5, but the fees for sending/withdrawing bitcoin are a total rob so I don't know if I'd even use it. Sent out €40 worth of bitcoin and got charged €8. That's 20%. Besides that, it's a decent lite trading app.","The app has so many bugs I have to reinstall it basically every day. The most recent one is that I cannot get past the enter pass code screen. To gain access I have to delete the app and then install a fresh one.","The app is very unstable. Completely agree with previous comments. Needs rebooting practically every day. Also, KYC is taken to the extreme making deposits a pain. I hold less than a quarter funds I had originally planned. I appreciate rigorous checks but not when its over the top."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.getchange.wallet.cordova","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.getchange.wallet.cordova&hl=en&gl=au"}
