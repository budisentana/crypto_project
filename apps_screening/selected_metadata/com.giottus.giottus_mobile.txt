I wish the UX could be more smoother. It can have Pie charts on Cost Price vs current price so that the user can see if he can sell the coin or keep it. Edit : The current update is doing good in terms of UX Design. Thanks ðŸ˜Š","App not opening from few weeks. It just hangs up at startup and does nothing. I am forced to use browser. It was working for me initially, not sure which update caused issue.","This Update brings me good app experience and no lags. I accept the UPI Issues sometimes , because of its banking side issue not yours. Finally found some good and simple crypto exchange india.","Needs improvement especially if there would have been direct deposit option. It would be better The charges have been increased from 0.150% to 0.250% . Open orders have been more feasible with more choices. If there would have been option to see the chart from 7 days 14 days or month or year comparisons. It would be best","In the markets tab, we couldn't able to sort the pair, last price and 24h chg columns. This feature is available only in the browser version. Please enable the sorting for the above three columns to analyse the market easily. Also, when I mark a coin as my favourite, it is actually not beeing picked up. Whenever I visit favourite tab in the markets, its always blank even after choosing multiple coins as my favourite item. Please fix."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.giottus.giottus_mobile","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.giottus.giottus_mobile&hl=en&gl=au"}
