I transferred myself some btc from an exchange and then uninstalled the app to test the recovery process. On entering the first 3 secret words there is no 'next option' or prompt to type in the remaining secret words. Instead you just have to start typing for the 4th 5th and 6th secret word boxes to appear. Fright of my life thinking I cant get my btc back. Hopefully the team can update that to make user experience a bit friendlier","Update: After several months support contacted me again and my issue was solved. Thanks a lot! I updated the score to 4 stars. One improvement would be to keep people updated on support inquiries to prevent them from feeling forgotten. [Initial comment from May 17 2021] I would give 0 stars if possible. I cannot access my funds for several years now because of a defective 2FA reset system. Their support desk is not responding to my inquiry.","This is beyond totally usless ! You have the damned green next button covering the last words ; word 6 blocked just as 12 and all the last words are friggin blocked, morans. At least make the damn screen scrollable, or make the damn button transparent......pitiful","Migrate Another wallet is disabled on my device and I can't use the green wallet recovery to insert my seed Please give me a fix for this","Easy to use and set up, guides you along the way"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.greenaddress.greenbits_android_wallet","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.greenaddress.greenbits_android_wallet&hl=en&gl=au"}
