They claim im only getting back for 2 transactions even though they owe me more.. and they said I have to wait 10 days.. after 10 days they said wait 10 more days... I'm going on day 25 still waiting!! DO NOT DOWNLOAD PEOPLE!! THEY SCAM","Crashes instantly on Android (all I see is the splash screen, then it crashes)... will happily rate 5 stars as soon as I see it work :) --edit: Changed rating from 1 to 3 stars because the app works if I uninstall it, scan the 2d barcode from your website, and directly install the .apk. You should update the apk in the android store!","So easy to use this wallet."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.hconline.iso","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hconline.iso&hl=en&gl=au"}
