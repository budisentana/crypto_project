Also, the ui is a mess and a big turn off to new non tech savvy users. Also price data is just plain wrong in places.. Several coins have wonky amounts that don't reflect reality.. I think if transaction details were obscured, ui was updated, and price finders were made accurate this would be a great wallet. It's just not there yet.","I came for the game but stayed for the privacy. The app takes a little getting used to, however now I know what I'm doing it works well. There is a community tied to the project, with a furum access able from the app. The people on there are really welcoming and will help if you have problems or questions.","I think someone had a good idea and quit halfway through developing it. Its absolutely NOT user-intuitive AT ALL, and although it says you can buy coin there...0h 0I dont think you really can. I've been waiting more than 12 hours just for a deposit to go through","Great idea... BE VERY careful about what coin you put into this wallet, as many coins DO NOT work, and you won't be able to exchange them without paying more in fees then their worth. Works well if you fallow the tutorials."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.incognito.wallet","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.incognito.wallet&hl=en&gl=au"}
