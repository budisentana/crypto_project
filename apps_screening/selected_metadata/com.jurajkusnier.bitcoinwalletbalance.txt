But around the beginning of March 2021 is stopped working and reports that there is no Internet connection.","Doesn't work on my OnePlus 6T \"No network connection\" or something to that effect. Shame because I wanted a means of a way for my friends to occasionally check the balance of some small Bitcoin gifts I've been giving away. Deal is once it hits 100x what I put in, they get the balance less the initial investment. A interest free investment loan. I keep the private keys since they don't know what to do with them anyway. They remain safely locked away in a Trezor. Could be great app, if it worked!","It worked great for one day only after that its just keep saying \"no internet connection\" over the same wifi","Simple and easy to use! Perfect for reading the balance of paper wallets.","Works, and has a favorites feature to make chexking a set list of wallets easy. Is open source and can be checked out on github. Definitely earned the 5 stars by doing 1 thing extremely well."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.jurajkusnier.bitcoinwalletbalance","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jurajkusnier.bitcoinwalletbalance&hl=en&gl=au"}
