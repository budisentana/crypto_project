Please fix this problem","2FA is painful. I have a fairly old phone and swapping between the auth app and Kinesis resets the login screen. Not enough time to enter code before refresh. Offer option to text code instead? That way it appears at the top of screen without needing to navigate away. Some apps like WhatsApp can also automatically read and submit the code from text which would be awesome.","App is useless!! Trying to set up says I have to put in my info keeps sending me out of app then tells me to log in and won't let me do that from browser that it sent me to! Like the idea of gold backed but until you get a working app piss off.","I really wanted to use this app. I went through so many verifications between my computer and my phone, that was nearly an hour of work to get to where I could finally make a deposit and buy some gold or silver. Then they tell me I have to go to the Australia National bank website to actually deposit money, which requires creating another new profile. I'm done, this is ridiculous.","Terrible app, nothing but problems from the beginning!
