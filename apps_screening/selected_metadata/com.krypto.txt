So very tough to earn a profit... Im regretting spending money on this wallet, wazirx is much cheaper...","They don't even let you withdraw your money. Every time I tried to withdraw my own money it showed some or the other error and rejected the transfer. This app is absolutely rubbish and I would not suggest anyone to use it EVER!!!","Great app. Not too sophisticated, but still has set Limit functionality. Deposits work seamless whether UPI or Bank transfer. Zero fees for coin purchases and sales. Though I am skeptical about the company especially after what happened in the Turkey Crypto Exchange scam. The founders look legit, but personally I would like more assurances about the company not being a scam, before I invest significantly. Specially cos they charge no fees for trades and makes me wonder how long they can go on.","There's a mismatch in live price and price shown in the app. List prices for popular cryptos like DOGE and ETH on your app is way higher than the market value.
