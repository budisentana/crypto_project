Sometimes even the Total Holdings doesn't add up. Can someone help? Thanks.","Shocking, over priced useless wallet. Don't entertain it. Just lost £40 for nothing literally nothing I'm so angry.","Is there a way to get the old Jaxx app functioning? I have tried to insert the phrase there but there is no Continye button. Forcing me to use the new app. I need the recover the wallet I had from the old Jaxx app. I didn't get the chance to move to the new version of Jaxx. PLEASE help.","Easy to use, high transaction fees (but that's the bitcoin miner fee, it's the same no matter what wallet is used), only thing keeping it from being 5 stars is the fact that the minimum for exchanging altcoims is 52 euro which is quite high (as in, if I want to convert BTC to etherium, I have to convert a minimum of 52 euro worth) but overall a good, safe, easy to use app."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.liberty.jaxx","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.liberty.jaxx&hl=en&gl=au"}
