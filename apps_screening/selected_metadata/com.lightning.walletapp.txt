It has everything one may need and they all work flawlessly. You can open both custodial and non-custodial Lightning channels. Custodial channel can be used more easily and to start receiving immediately, and non-custodial channels can be used for more security and to have more control. I wish you devs success and looking forward for more features. I wondered why you deprecated such a gem. Thank you for undeprecating it.","I just download the app and find the wallet.
