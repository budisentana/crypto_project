I sent LTC first thing this morning and it says some bs about andriod keystore, my restore wallet feature is greyed out and every time I try and tap to make a new one or anything it force closes. The transaction was sent to (what was my wallet) i have the comf and all. Ugh. I would NOT refer anyone to this wallet. No offense LTC but what the hell?","Before, the app was not responding after syncing for about two days but now it's working. I don't know what happened but I am glad it's finally okay. While not really helpful in my case, I appreciate the replies from the dev.","My wallet quit opening & then when it did open, it's not accepting my pin. The app never gave me my paper keys so now I'm out the money that was in it.","Terrible experience trying to withdraw, the fee for sending always too low even though you say it's the luxury one. Can't transfer out terrible guess it's there forever sucky","very bad to use . can't even send my coin to the exchange and the fee is cutting again and again .. Really bad experience"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.loafwallet","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.loafwallet&hl=en&gl=au"}
