Very happy with App and great to see new features being added. The ability to purchase has LTC has been great if slightly expensive. Worth the expense for the convenience.","All was good until recently. I sent LTC first thing this morning and it says some bs about andriod keystore, my restore wallet feature is greyed out and every time I try and tap to make a new one or anything it force closes. The transaction was sent to (what was my wallet) i have the comf and all. Ugh. I would NOT refer anyone to this wallet. No offense LTC but what the hell?","Before, the app was not responding after syncing for about two days but now it's working. I don't know what happened but I am glad it's finally okay. While not really helpful in my case, I appreciate the replies from the dev.","The only way I found to easily convert from paper to wallet. However, it's not as simple as 1, 2, 3. Constantly resyncing and importing too many times. It eventually works, but it literally takes 6 hours. Second night still working on it...on hour 7!!! Why is no one paying attention to this app? And we wonder why LTC is not higher in value. Thanks for your response. However, I disagree. I had 10 paper wallets. 3 of the 10 went through easily. I went to coinomi which took less than 10 minute","Excellent. So far, after 2 weeks, 6 diff transactions of receiving. Then, from there, sending to my own wallet. I assure everyone it has worked great for me! There's a small, little learning curve. After that( like after couple successful trans)you'll be fine! I have a note9. Litewallet is real deal, it def has shown no issues to me, yet, and Im now even tippng them tiny bit each time i do a transaction! It helps from what i understand! 4.5 stars, there's lil room for slight improvement on ui."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.loafwallet","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.loafwallet&hl=en&gl=au"}
