The Stellar Network is fast and low cost. But... Beware there are many fake/copycat tokens on the Stellar Network. Make sure you are buying what you really want. Super easy free to send in house. Test it out send tips. PCmedic_Stellar*lobstr.co","I'm frustrated at all. I try to swap USD to XLMG but the rate was to 0.0026$ at Lobstr and 0.000008$ at the coinbase and marketcap. I also saw the 24H high and low prices but I'm stunned there is no difference at all there, and if you'll visit the coinbase or marketcap you'll see a huge difference. That's disgusting!!!","Very quick and snappy that admittedly does have a bit of a learning curve for those new to the crypto game. After you get the system down, it's a breeze to use. No problems experienced yet that weren't actually my own fault. Good job so far guys. Looking forward to more cryptocurrencies being made available for purchase through Lobstr but I understand that's not completely up to Lobstr.","No issues. Easy. Great interface. I don't buy through them, I buy through Atomic Wallet, send to Lobstr, and trade or exchange. Literally done in minutes. Don't like or trust Moonpay. Too many bad stories. I know Atomic's fees are a bit higher, but I'd rather pay the fee and be done than have the stress of transactions that don't go through.","It's good up until the last update When I open the app it flickers and says check internet connection. It won't go past that."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.lobstr.client","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lobstr.client&hl=en&gl=au"}
