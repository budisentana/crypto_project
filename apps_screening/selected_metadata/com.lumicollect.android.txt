Do you guys plan to release an update for this soon or is it dead. I'd really like to be able to get all my nfts off of it if that were the case.","I've had a mostly positive experience with Lumi. There is a level of patience needed with blockchain, but i imagine that since this is a mobile app as opposed to a the desktop extensions it requires even more patience. Currently, i have a question that maybe related to the recent update. it used to be that my collectables (cryptokitties) were visible in the wallet and in the dapp. Now they only show in the dapp itself. I miss seeing them in the wallet! Any chance of getting that function back?","Great app, love all the content and settings options. I've had it on three phones so its user friendly with android","Great app, easy to access app that you love and new ones that you will soon love","It's free and I haven't come across any issues with it.
