Keep up the good work guys","Easy setup, lots of coin options. Overall does more than I needed it to do, and exceeded my expectations.","I did not have a good experience with this wallet at all... I tested it out. Exchanged $75 in BTC into SHIB coing. Got literally charged $25 in fees. 30% of my money gone in ONE EXCHANGE ... That is outrageous...","Great app, very clean interface. Could use dark mode support. Would like to see support for more crypto. 1inch and AMP specifically üôè","Only just started using it but clean and easy to navigate. **Update** I've been using Lumi wallet for a bit longer now and have been very impressed by the app and by the team behind it. When I had a problem they responded incredibly quickly and were able to solve it rapidly and kept me up to date as they did."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.lumiwallet.android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lumiwallet.android&hl=en&gl=au"}
