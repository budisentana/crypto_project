Major problem is the lag which often ends in crashes. Everytime it does that, all the scores and GWEI went with it, leaving you back on level 1. Crashes are very common when you're doing great with your game. It's like it does not favor that you win and make great points. As to the ETH you can earn, it's too minute and almost neglible to even think playing this game for years can change your life in the long run.","Amazing game ! I find myself sitting down for a quick 5-10 game and an hour later I'm still playing. It really does pay out, instantly ! EDIT : 07-25-21 The game used to be 5 stars, now it's a weak 3 star game. Adds have increased 100%. I just scored 32000+ and for that effort, I was given 675 gwei ?!! A score like that should have paid out 4x that amount. Come on team, don't get cheap on us, the price of Ethereum is down. The payout SHOULD GO UP !!!!!!","Does what it says it does. Great mindless game for meetings or when watching TV. If you're going to mess around on Candy Crush, why not get paid for it? I've made some decent cash off of this and it's funding my smaller crypto investments. Yeah, there's ads. You get used to them, especially once you know how long they last. Just put the tv on and look up when an ad comes on. Great app, wish there were more like it.","Pays out easily and quickly with coinbase. 5 stars. The game is fun. BUT!!! constantly glitches and you have to start over. I was just on a roll, my best game. Start of level 6, a flash, and im back at level 1, and my coins are gone! You still get credit for ETH. But its totally deflating, and makes people stop playing. IF THE GAME STOPPED CRASHING ID GIVE 5 STARS AND PLAY MORE. VERY DISAPPOINTED","Sure enough, it pays out Ethereum almost instantly. It's kind of hard to get figured out, though. You need to go into where it says redeem in order to get it sent to your wallet. Doesn't add up fast at all, but it's an all right time waster. And tons of ads, but that should be a given for anyone looking at this kind of thing. I'd love to see a cleaner interface and more information about how much is paid out per point, but that's easy enough to figure out."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.mansoon.cryptopop","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mansoon.cryptopop&hl=en&gl=au"}
