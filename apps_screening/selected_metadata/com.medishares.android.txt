The problem with casting a wide net like that is that you tend to be average for everything else. Functionality is average. UI isn't as intuitive as it should be, but they will improve it. Like I said, this app has support for so many blockchains it's pretty crazy. Thanks team.","One of the best wallet I have ever seen in last 7 years, 23 different blockchain by default added. Very good and easy to use....thnx","This app was a wonderful piece of tech making everyday trading and dapp usage easier then ever. However recently it has started to crash every time I try to log in, its a nightmare. I belive the new update is the culprit as It only shows me vchain as a possible log in option. (Update) App has been updated and I'm back on track, super happy to be able to access everything without issue again. Thanks guys.","Works well and does everything i need. Great multiwallet application with pretty decent yield.","very good wallet tbh, but i would like if they add custom rpc + web3 support (like opera wallet), also theres a problem with solana USDC that use solana main address instead SPL address (which can lead ppl to lose money) so i hope you guys can fix this issues"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.medishares.android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.medishares.android&hl=en&gl=au"}
