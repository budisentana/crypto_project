On the Spot wallet page where I'm supposed to see my coins/assets, it is so scattered that I have to scroll through the entire list looking for my coins. Can you please arrange them in the order that coins which I have come at the top of the coin list? Or at least, sort your coins alphabetically to make it easier finding my assets??? üòíüòíüòí","I've got to change my review to 5 ‚≠ê It's a great app and very useful. I was wrong that they didn't sending Email Verification. It just happens that it was sent to the Spam Section of my email.. üòÖ","Very good app. Lots of coins, easy nice ui. Good volumes. Useful bridge to matic and more. I'm happy. Just one thing, the longs and shorts are horrible. I do have experience, and this options are so wrong (after 20% up in base coin the option moved 5%. Happens a lot and really, don't touch the futures/options. Also, answer I received were not convincing. All the rest is great, especially the withdrawals, are not expensive as othe centrelized exchanges. Recomand. Best of luck","Too much crashing at every order. UI is not friendly. No real time update. It takes fractions of seconds gap complicated. And till today 14 July since one month they haven't solved the issue.","frozen twice for nothing always on wednesday or thursday to take additional 2 days not to be able to use the app till you get the report. First report frozen due to kyc. I understood after that you cannot get frozen due to this reason. Waiting for the new report. Take care guys with this exchange. 1 star due to wasted me in total 2 weeks for the frozen part. Not nice. Updatw this time might take even more time 7 days to unfreeze - watching the price going up and down and not doing anything."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.mexcpro.client","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mexcpro.client&hl=en&gl=au"}
