But after a while you realize that it's buggy as hell! I'm not even able to login anymore hahaha (a huge error list appears - even after reinstallation). It's always general rule, never send serious amounts of crypto to new wallets as you never know what might happen. I'm glad I only played the wheel once in a while. Those 0,001 $ I \"earned\", well, forget about it. I'm outta here.","DONT DOWNLOAD. Vinex.network is the exchange service they use and they took my ETH and TRX. Only assets I had deposited. It's been a month and when they do respond, its to say \"patient please it will take time\". My ETH is frozen and my 6000 TRX has been in a pending withdrawl state for a month. Their excuse is that \"large amount require review\"...r they serious? What's the point of even emailing me back? The entire issue is a 5 min max fix but with no key access, kiss your funds goodbye ..","Looking like scam, the 'free coins' previously obtained from 'spinning' are now not showing in wallet, with half of them not even available as a token to add. Previous balances show under transactions yet are nowhere to be found in wallet with balance reflecting this as well","I found this app from A user on Twitter and Im so Happy that i did because this Wallet has so many different features in it and plus it has daily Freebies, Whats not to Love! Definitely Recommend to try it!","This is the best crypto wallet I have used, can store all types of coin and token. I love swap feature. Suggest: please add the automic swap, this will make your app better."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.midasprotocol.wallet.android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.midasprotocol.wallet.android&hl=en&gl=au"}
