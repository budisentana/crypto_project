When I signed up, I checked the PIN option, had no issues signing up, but kept getting a 401 error at the top of the app while exploring. I relaunched the app, and was prompted to sign in with a \"password\" field and given a PIN keyboard. I was unable to log in with my PIN or password so I had to reset the app. After resetting the app I chose not to set up with a PIN and it signs in fine now. Still seeing a 401 error.","This is currently my bridge to invest in crypto. Since I live in Europe, it's quite hard to deposit it withdrawal from my bank account. Using my bridge account, I manage to pay a lot less fees making transfers both ways from fiat to crypto. I also hold some MTS to pay even less fees. A normal bank deposit to ETH takes 24h or less to be processed after your bank executes the order.","Very easy to use. I like the security knowing their your keys, your coins. And being able to buy tokenized securities is the future. Go Bridge Wallet.","I had my funds back in the crypto wallet as there is no other choice. However, my bank has been asking for specific details for them to verify your fund transfer in fiat GBP like a reference number of such and senders name and acct. #, but you gave an incomplete info of what i had been asking from you in my multiple emails. I have given you all my account details with screenshot. It was frustrating and dissapointing and the fiat conversion to bank transfer is unsuccessful. But thank you still.","Thanks for your quick reply, and for fixing the Wallet issue. I have registered myself and submitted my KYC documents. Now everything seems fine. Thank you! üòä"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.mtpelerin.bridge","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mtpelerin.bridge&hl=en&gl=au"}
