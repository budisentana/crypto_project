Would give zero stars if it were on option. I sent $190 worth of btc to the wallet on 14/7/2021 and even after confirmation, the balance page keeps showing zeroes. The funds remain within the transaction page where it is inaccessible. Repeated emails to the customer support has not been replied. Anyone should avoid this app like a plague. Looks very much like a scam app. How do I access my funds now?","Terrible lost about 500€ trying to competed two transactions. I tried sending my btc at the fastest time and an error came up. I check my wallet and the btc is gone, so I waited and the btc was not sent in time (10 min). Done with this app.","I'm hoping you can assist, I had an btc account in 2017/2018 and have intern changed phones, I do not know about this 12 key recovery as I'm sure it was not an option back then, is there any other way of recovering a old account or is it a lost cause, Edit, thank you for your response","250 dollars in btc were sent and pending for hours. I canceled the transaction and it said the funds would be returned. It's been almost two weeks and the funds were not returned. I emailed my logs and got no response. I've tried multiple connections, none connect correctly and now the money is lost. Help?","I've used this app for sooo lonng and now it is impossible to get my money out. It says \"failed to broadcast\" even if i set the highest gas limit you can imagine, it looks like the app isnt even connected to the ethereum network anymore. [Edit1: It seems the app wont let me put fees higher than 0.2$ which wouldnt work] [Edit2: I did what the developers asked in the answer and never got any answer back from them, let alone a resolution. I emailed them and their info mail, I did anything I could]"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.mycelium.wallet","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mycelium.wallet&hl=en&gl=au"}
