But have to give em 1 star btc deposit is curently at 11 hrs and counting since being fully confirmed on the blockchain but not reflected in account. I was told third party handles deposits and it would be a few hours that was 6 hrs ago shamefull amount of time for crypto to be transfered. Idk happens every deposit no smooth deposits.","I started using My Container in June 2020 and I have deposited a bunch of coins on there, also subscribed to the POWER subscription. At first it did run smooth but now I do not get coins every month for the extra subscription. There are some things that I do not agree with, one is that the POWER subscription just got raised without any notice, the second one is that there is a minimum withdrawal for coins and the third is that one does not get rewards for the coins he gets on the subscription. The phone app is a bit shady and has some glitches once in a while like not showing exact amounts, or mistaking the amounts received with euro currency. My humble opinion is that it is a service that can be improved. I would like to see more details on the coins and earnings, 8 decimals as they should be. I would like to not have a minimum withdrawal and maybe get rewards for the rewarded coins one gets. Besides these things that some wouldn't consider minor, the service is a decent staking and masternode service. I do enjoy the giveaways that they have once in a while. Thank you","The app isn't too bad. It lacks all the features you'll find on the website, but it keeps up. This app is pretty much unlike most others in terms of crypto currencies. They offer you airdrops left and right and all sorts of ways to earn. There are some downsides. My KYC verification took about 20 tries. I'm not sure why, but it did eventually go through. If you are looking for an app that will reward you for staking crypto this one will do it. Just be alert that you'll need to stake ~$100 worth of whatever it is you are staking, or you won't be able to withdraw it until it hits that level. The APR earnings are just ridiculously high so it's definitely worth investing some time and effort into. I'll be using them for a a while.","Unexpectedly robust app! Walked through the app for to login and check the mobile UI. Perfect and Very tidy! But it would be more entertaining and not boring if you guys add some twist on it, some rewarding game/s, maybe spin the wheel, some scratching games, or coin prediction. As a user and money making online hunter, that is a ++ bonus. Or daily check in that rewards that makes us go check the app daily. :)","The app seems okay overall. The Web version is way better than this app, both in functionality and UI. The app is a lot limited and is mostly useful for getting legit and up to date airdrops. Otherwise than that, I can say there is need for a lot of improvements. But I'm good with the app, I see they are making a lot of progress."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.mycontainer","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mycontainer&hl=en&gl=au"}
