I intended to buy the dip so it had to be quick and it actually was. I sent my docs for KYC right within the app and just a couple of hours later I received my coins.","This btc wallet is a really good application. First of all, the design is great and very clear. The operation is optimal. I've been looking for an btc wallet like this for a long time and I'm glad I finally found it! I can really recommend the app to everyone !!","Seems to be a decent wallet, you can manage your coins with it and also buy them. The fees are about average on the market.","I really enjoy the app but it's a shame there's no way to cash out here. Sending to another service to withdraw isn't a nice work around as you lose too much on fees. Please consider adding this possibility","I've used 4 or 5 wallets and I think Ownr is the most user-friendly one. The instant assistance by customer service adds to this impression."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.ownrwallet.wallet","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ownrwallet.wallet&hl=en&gl=au"}
