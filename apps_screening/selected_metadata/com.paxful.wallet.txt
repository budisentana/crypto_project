We’ve squished some nasty bugs and made performance improvements to give you a better Paxful experience.","comments":["Edit: got scammed (didn't follow guides- lesson learned). The app lets you pay someone, then cancel the trade without seller confirming they've refunded :\\ Used in-app reporting, but nothing happened. Later learned you have to raise a support ticket to quickly sort disputes. However, support was great once they were on it, and won the dispute pretty quickly. There's a slightly frustrating learning curve, and UI can be a bit clunky, but once you find how to get help they're good. Thanks :]","This app use to be very great and smooth. After the recent update, I can't even login anymore. As soon as I inputs my login details, it says network timeout. It's so sad.","It can't open after updating it !!!.The previous app was much better than the current one. It shows error and can't open Can't access my Paxful wallet.","Take much time on one trade,another fast option should be initiated,i think it like auto option,one person want to sell and fix the rate for sell,should be his name and bank account mention on trade page. Buyer just see and send money to his account, and escrow release the currncy. Why the chat option is initiated when the person want to sell,just wastage of time, Should be fast,your prosses is very slow and disappouting.","Lost money account hacked founds transferred without my outhrisation, and without use of google authenticate, totally unsecured. Do not use this, run and operated by scamers. If there is possibility for 0 starts i would give you. Hope playstore takes you down. Will loge complain to Google play store."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.paxful.wallet","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.paxful.wallet&hl=en&gl=au"}
