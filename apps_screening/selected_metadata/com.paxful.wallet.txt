It's not a difficult case. From reviews here and elsewhere, it's clear there are a lot of scammers on the platform, so myb it's the sheer quantity of cases that's making it take so long to address? It's been viewed already- what else is there to review? + No communication at all :|","This app use to be very great and smooth. After the recent update, I can't even login anymore. As soon as I inputs my login details, it says network timeout. It's so sad.","Paxful is a great P2P platform. But I want to talk about the recent update of trade menu. there is not any option to see the exact market price of the particular trade. previously that option was quite helpful whenever the market was fluctuating but now it creates confusion and have to use calculator to see the exact market amount of particular trade please help","Unable to verify my phone number every time app showing an error and notify try after some time, along with that website is also very poor saying enter a valid phone. Worst app i have ever seen. What should i do by contact support there is a automated reply by bot, redirecting me on a page to tell me how to verify phone. That is really idiotic thing bg paxful. You need to fix the issue at you app and website.","Its a really good platform for trade ,But suddenly my offers went to unresponsive list bottom of the list which means they are not in their position and i raised alot of tickets contact support dont have proper answer for that they saying our system have new ranking procedure but evn i have more thn 100 positive feedbacks without any single negative one how can my offers went down in unresponsive or unactive list?? Plz confirm it and get my offers in their original positions please...."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.paxful.wallet","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.paxful.wallet&hl=en&gl=au"}
