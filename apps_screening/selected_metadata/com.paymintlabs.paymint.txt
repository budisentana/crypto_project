My husband and I recently downloaded your app and he signed up for it so that he  could have a bitcoin account and address therefore someone could send us $300 worth of bitcoin then we would transfer that into cash and once it was sent we couldn't do anything with it or get it off or transfer or even log back into the account . We have been fighting with this for 3 days now and getting no where and I want the fixed now . yall are a damn scam and I want my money NOW","I got to know the app thanks to the post in r/bitcoin. The app UI looks good for my taste and it is easy to use. My only concern is the pattern lock, I suggest adding the option to use a PIN code instead (or a password, just give the user the right to choose) Edit: there is fingerprint support.","Although I'm not too aware about Bitcoin/Blockchain, I installed your app because I am a flutter dev too, and it just seems marvellous! The ui is just flawless and looks like a lot of effort went into it.üôè Way to go!","Not currently connecting, won't show balance. Really frustrating. Is no bitcoin provider working properly these days?","Really good wallet. I like the emphasis on coin control. Wish I could connect to my full node though"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.paymintlabs.paymint","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.paymintlabs.paymint&hl=en&gl=au"}
