Smooth actions very well put together app thank you to the whole team but exspecially to the programmers & Development team. Bravo everyone!","simple and nice interface to use. also secure and safe way to protect our currencies. Paytomat provided more options. I love them.","Love this wallet.Simple easy and nice interface. Highly appreciated to add tron coin (trx). Tron is super fast tx. It is great to be integrated inside paytomat wallet.","It is perfect wallet.... I liked the bitpay purse for a long time because it has small commissions well but it is not possible to convert between currencies and also does not support many currencies .... Now this purse best purse configuration in terms of services and small commission I recommend","The Mnemonic phrase seed test is useless. I tried it twice & couldn't proceed with the Registration process because of it.. Immediately uninstall paytomat wallet from my phone. I don't have time for such stress..they are thousands of available & good crypto wallet app for me to choose and use."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.paytomat","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.paytomat&hl=en&gl=au"}
