I get few issues as below but cracked it. You need to wait until transaction fee shows up. And if you make more that one transaction, you need to wait for one to be successful before making new one.","I wan to send my credit to other wallet but always i get message transfer cancelled . I don't know why this app not working good .","App wont let me send any bitcoin out!! This is really frustrating app sucks","Sent BTC to the Pint wallet, they took a small reasonable fee. Tried to transfer it out, they want a network fee that exceeds the value of the wallet. The trading potential is horrible, they support very few cryptos and the exchange minimums are in the hundreds of dollars. Every competitor of theirs has very little fees, and no trade minimums. Dont make thus your primary wallet, coin goes in but its impossible to swap it or send it out without losing a significant money to BS fees.","After using a few wallets as my main storage and transfering wallet after purchase on coinbase, I have been using this app for 3 months with no issues at all. It's easy to use and fast. I had to contact support as one of my transfers was not sending and they were prompt to reply and put my mind as ease that the funds would be available once my transfer was confirmed on the block chain and sure enough they were a few minutes later. A wallet with privacy in mind, which I like."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.pint.app","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pint.app&hl=en&gl=au"}
