The interest earning options require a KYC application with Prime Trust. My application was pending for over 2 months with no explanation. My repeated attempts to get more information resulted in automated, bot generated emails, and no action. ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE customer service!!! At least I was able to take my BTC out.","Multiple attempts over the past four months to verify KYC proved futile, even when app confirms successful completion of verification process. All requests for assistance through Abra's customer service yield no results in rectifying the issue. Not only does it take customer service, in average, three weeks to respond to inquiries, but their response is always the same; to follow the app step by step guide to complete KYC verification.","Love this app low fees for swaping coins. Been using for a few months now and had my first problem today totally my fault didn't send required amount of eth and transaction didn't go through, messaged customer support and got a reply within 24 hours and sorted the problem quickly, I think good customer support is a must in crypto apps and Abra gets 10/10 from me, just the fact they replied compared to Binance who totally ignored my emails gives me a lot of confidence in this app.","Terrible. Made an account and was asked to apply for prime trust to facilitate wire transfers. Application's pending for several weeks now. Tried to reach customer support, but no response. Terrible app, worst customer support team.","Cant retrieve my account one of the words i wrote is wrong This not a good app.. i hope youll have a better way to retrieve the account.. i mean.. how is it possible we can create a new account with just all same information . And not retrieve the existing one.. you think the recovery phrase is such a good idea.. well whoever thought of it seriously ugh.. cant even express the word"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.plutus.wallet","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.plutus.wallet&hl=en&gl=au"}
