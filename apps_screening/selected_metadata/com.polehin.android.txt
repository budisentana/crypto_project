It was not like this from the start. To transfer from one wallet to another can cost $10-$20 and to purchase coin, the fee is hell on earth.","I wrote a review before seems to me that they deleted it and since I contacted the support there hasn't been any help from them whatsoever I have over $8000 USD stucked here and I have been using this app for long on my IOS but it wasn't available afterwards and I decided to use it on andriod but I think IOS removed it after it detected it was scam why won't playstore do the same they don't value the app users or what ....... What a shame but this are one of the reasons I hate andriods","The fees make it so you'll never increase your amount of money or crypto. It costs so much to exchange crypto that you'll never climb the ladder and you'll be left with what you walked in with. Also it crashes when its a good time to buy or sell and it freezes I have to restart over and over to update. Good old fashioned white collar crime. Using us to make money.waste of time and unreliable and over priced. I should be the one getting payed its my money invested not theirs. Lesson learned.","Huge fees usually over 5 GBP for just one transfer. Even higher fees for crypto purchase. Selectable option to send Monero but comes up with a message stating this isn't implemented yet. Often massive wait times for funds to clear as well. Sometimes days. Also no blockchain hash given for transactions so you can't track anything. Their website comes up with an error and if you try to reset your password with the code they send in an email. It says its wrong. So no way of recovering account."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.polehin.android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.polehin.android&hl=en&gl=au"}
