They don't seem overlying worried about the issue I was having. Simply told me they couldn't replicate it and stopped responding to me. The issue I had was Firo coin never made it to the Polispay app and every time I open the Firo balance, the send/receive options wouldn't load. Desktop and Android apps effected. Did basic reload, refresh and reinstall. I don't recommend this app.","I have been using polispay since 2020, But this time after I send ethereum to another address it failed. I chose the highest fee polispay could ever offer but it failed not only once but twice. Now my balance is half the balance I want to send because they deducted it. Balance not transferred because out of gas. POLISPAY is a thief!","Frustrating! Glitchy! App won't allow transactions or epay Top-up purchases. Sent messages to helpdesk with high importance - no response. Now I have to search out alternative. Annoyed! Update: Helpdesk responded. Desktop app works with no issues, although shift is still unavailable (3 months).","Love the app and the Polispay Mastercard that connects to it. Using different currencies while traveling is a breeze. Awesome multi coin wallet!","Installed mainly to load some DeepOnion. It's a snappy and sleek app with clean interface. Good all-rounder. Will keep."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.polispay.copay","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.polispay.copay&hl=en&gl=au"}
