Have usdc I'm trying to move, $993.00, have 0.01 eth for gas fee, sending max amouny after 2 % trans fee. I always get a message \"something wrong, try again later\" what am i doing wrong? Thanks. after reply and opened a support ticket silence... decided SCAM ALERT! 1k stolen.","It's an amazing app!! User-friendly interface, secure credentials, and ability to unite all my cryptos in one place!! It provides me with more than I expected!! Especially I like that using it, I can pay for things that otherwise were unavailable for me!!!","I am really enjoying the app. its quick to use and i really like the ability to create multiple crypto wallets within the wallet. definitely recommend for those new to crypto. gave it 4 stars because waiting for different language support. EDIT: Good update, here, have 5 stars!","I love this wallet, it has amazing features, stands out from the other wallets on the market. Easy to navigate + user friendly. Cool lottery feature, great business promotion capabilities. Overall, has few links, but makes a great product.","I love the app, expecially the shopping map. When it gets more companies on board it will be a great convenience. I do have some questions though. 1) Does the app support staking rewards? For instance you have VET and Neo listed, can they be staked from the wallet? 2) Will Erc-20 tokens show if sent to the eth address or is it non token compatible?"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.ptpwallet","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ptpwallet&hl=en&gl=au"}
