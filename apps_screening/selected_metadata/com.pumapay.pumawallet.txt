Each time says wrong email or password, I know it is the right email ofcourse because it is the only one, and I changed the password just in case I really forget it after one day which I am not, then I used the new password and still can't log in, very bad, no customer service or a reason why I can't log in ... don't waste your money and time","Imposible to login, when I try to login it keeps showing a message: something went wrong, please try again. It doesn't allow me to login again, it ask me for name and date of birth, after I try to submit the information, it gets stuck with that error message. I was able to login once, tried to do the verification process, but errors show. Pretty bad app.","The only reason I got this app was to use the exchange, but when I click on the Exchange button, it says \"this feature is not available in your region\". Have never found anyone available on live support. Message always says \"we'll be back tomorrow\".","couldn't login, it always crash after submitting password. I tried on two different devices with clean install, pretty the same even on an emulator. just useless."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.pumapay.pumawallet","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pumapay.pumawallet&hl=en&gl=au"}
