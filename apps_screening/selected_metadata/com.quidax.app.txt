They are not yet where they are going but they are consistently improving. Please the fees should be reviewed and slashed. Try and see if you can make the app more user-friendly. Also,it will be nice if the app can have an interface whereby both the order book and the list of coins can be seen in a page at a glance. You are doing nice job.","I have been using the app for a very long time now..the app is really nice and the interface is understandable. the Google authenticator before login it more better for security reasons. And one of the reason I like trading with quidax it's that.. it's customer service doesn't waste time to solve any issue sent to them through mail. But I will like price alert to be added.","I'm dissatisfied with this App. I'm wasting 1 Star on it because I don't see an option less than 1 star. I made a deposit to my Tron wallet provided by this platform, The transaction has over 6000 block confirmations now but my Quidax Account has not been credited. Days has passed, I contacted the irresponsible support, alongside the transaction HASH, I haven't gotten any response from them for over 48 hours. This platform is terrible.","Upgrading my rating for this app from a 2-star to a 4.5-star rating for the following reasons: - the app has a very simple user interface - the team are working tirelessly to expand the app functionality and user experience - more work needs to be done to increase app speed though, and also to minimize errors - other than these, the quidax app is an amazing app. Huge kudos to the team for their wonderful work thus far. Keep doing more guys!","This is the best app for me this year,not just for the sake of rating 5 star but the sake of appreciating usefulness and quality.The great features embedded in Quidax are unique beyond imaginations, is it the security and privacy priority, customer satisfaction, flawless transactions or the very friendly user interface of the app and even the website, or even the pleasant and admirable customer care, not limited to these, but to mention a few.I will rate 10 stars if possible!
