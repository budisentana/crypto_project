Try it out!","comments":["I love this app, only issue i have is the fees used when buying through debit card, since we are restricted to euro and pounds, 4% seems kind of high in relation to usd. Otherwise, a very good and private app, i recommend it.","Mega scam here - It's like someone saw all that is wrong with banking and create an app with all those issues. avoid at all costs.72hrs is the normal transaction time and more often than not it will be declined and will cost £3.97 PER TRANSACTION.. customer service will show you how much they do not care about customers. I will never used this again WORST BANKING APP by far.. They should be illegal.. Their reply below is just another lie.. Just read other reviews and see","I've had money trapped in my wallet for months, support are not helping me at all and don't answer me for days and days. I've been waiting to transfer my btc for so so long. Avoid this wallet if you can. The 'support' have said they've given me instructions, but none of them have worked. They have effectively stolen my bitcoin because their app is buggy and faulty. If I could give below 1*, I absolutely would.","I transferred 560€ from my revolut , payment was delayed and my quppy account blocked. I got a message from quppy finance department that they were asking for a photo of my bank card that I used to top up my quppy wallet. I informed that it was a wire transfer and there is an error in their system, I attached a confirmation of transaction, generated from my revolut. My message was ignored and I was asked again to show card from which I made payment. Turned out , quppy steal my 560€ !!!!!!!!!!!","Why is there a problem with the bitcoin cash section in wallet? I have not been able to trade for a week."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.quppy","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.quppy&hl=en&gl=au"}
