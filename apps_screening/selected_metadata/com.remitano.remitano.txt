When this is resolved then I can put up stars.","The update is no longer working, this latest update is no longer opening.. it keeps crashing over and over again","Very good app but currently when I try to login the app it bounce back and refuse to log me in, I can only login through Chrome which is not convinent and secure for me","Very frustrating App. I deposited some money into my wallet yesterday the 4th of may 2021. And got a feedback that transaction has been cancelled. I used the live chat to lay my complain and submitted every evidence of transfer. One chi-chi whom I was chatting with confirmed that she could see the transaction, but I can't get credited or have a refund until I verify my identity. Despite knowing that the amount(#9001.60) was within my verification level( phone verification) this is pure Evil."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.remitano.remitano","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.remitano.remitano&hl=en&gl=au"}
