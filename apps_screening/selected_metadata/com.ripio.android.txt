We have great news:<br>- You can now operate with LINK and UNI<br>- We fixed general errors in the validation process<br>- We fixed the bug that showed the values in the charts in USD instead of the local currency<br>- We fixed general bugs in the crypto buy and sell sections","comments":["Awesome app. Easy to use. Limits could be higher though. Honestly they are too low. But platform works and is safe. Which is most important. Hope they raise those limits to be perfect!","Secure, quite ok if you wanna trade BTC/ETH and REALLY easy to use if you're new to crypto (make sure to check the current balance on Google, though, bc the app doesn't have good graphs for checking). Too bad it ALWAYS asks for login info (you could just add a digital reader feature so I wouldn't have to login every single time I close the app). It's fees are rather small compared to other crypto wallet apps so I guess it's fine","The application doesn't let me buy any coin. It let's transfer the money to Ripio agency (of course). But I try to buy Ethereum the app doesn't give me the option to confirm the purchase. Completely frustrating. Now what? I have to pay a fee to get the money back... joke","I can't activate my account because I never get the code by sms","Delay for trading is huge and annoying. Minimum are pretty high to operate. I just give up the little amounts that I have"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.ripio.android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ripio.android&hl=en&gl=au"}
