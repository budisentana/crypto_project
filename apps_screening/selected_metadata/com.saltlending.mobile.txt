I hear this company doesn't respond to people anymore so they might be dissolved. Nice layout though","Nice app. But i just like theres an option less than the minimum that can loan","Worst app instead of app u could have created site only... I'm not able to proceed further after agreeing terms and conditions","With everything going to the new technologies way more cards with rfi'z, easier to use more bucks for a transxation","SALT Lending has copious issues. There are withdrawal issues, emailing issues, phone issues, payment issues, login issues and more. Their customer service is awful and their platform sucks. I had to wait 3 days for a withdrawal and missed out on an ICO which could end up costing me hundreds of thousands of dollars. I made a request for a withdrawal today and received an email saying I would have to wait 6 days before receiving it. Use NEXO instead. I have and they're 1000 times better than SALT."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.saltlending.mobile","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.saltlending.mobile&hl=en&gl=au"}
