The format is simple to understand and lets you customize for things like 1 gram mini bars or 1 oz bars or whatever else you might have. One improvement i would like to see is for users to upload their own images/types of coins to an admin for review/addition to the database.","Great database, will not allow me to sort coins into different wallets though.","Excellent app for keeping track your Silver coin collection and their current Silver melt values! I love how you can update the Silver Spot Price just by going to the app's settings! Also, the app is very accurate when calculating total Actual Silver Weight (ASW) in Troy Ounces and can manually be switched back to grams! I ended up with more Silver than expected! With that being said, this application is beyond accurate! Highly recommend it to Silver coin collectors, like myself! Happy hunting!","This app is a great concept. However, I was using it for some of my ads, the ASW for newer quarters is defaulting to 4.9 Oz. I just caught it after using it a few days. Please fix ASAP because I was looking like a liar, but I understand your app is still in development."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.silvercoinvaluerpro","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.silvercoinvaluerpro&hl=en&gl=au"}
