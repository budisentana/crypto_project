It was free but latest update is limited to only 3 WALLETS unless you upgrade to PRO, which is only... what? $1499.99 A YEAR? I recognize the big efforts of developers and quality of the app, but the out-of-a-sudden astronomic PRO prices just felt like an assault. I'm pretty sure there are many customers with deeper pockets that will not have any problem with these prices, so I hope they give you more stars. I'm changing my free rating to 1 star per wallet.","Wrong data displayed, no easy way to submit protocols for support.. Ok wallet, hope they add support for Goose finance","I was looking for something that supports bsc network and so far this seems great! The only issue is that it does not track funds that are deposited in certain contracts, but it shows the right values of my assets that are deposited in autofarm and beefy, overall I love the look and feel of it on first glance","So far so good. Some bugs here and there and alpaca finance isn't working but other than that it's a really good start as far as portfolio tracking. Especially for bunny and pancake.","Nice enough interface. A little lacking for my purposes as it appears to only sync with BSC and ETH Web3 wallets. As of today it doesn't appear to support FTM, SOLANA, and MATIC networks."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.sixpencer.simplework","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sixpencer.simplework&hl=en&gl=au"}
