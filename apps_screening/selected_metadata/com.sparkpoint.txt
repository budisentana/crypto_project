We appreciate your support of SparkPoint and all our apps!","comments":["I had some responsive issues inserting the pin on a 10 inch tablet and the instagram link is broken. If start a transfer and change to another app to copy the address and return I need to start again because the state is not saved. Also I tried to transfer the tokens to another wallet (Trust Wallet) and the app crashes. When I try to scan another safemoon address to send it recognizes the qrcode and decodes it but it desapears almost instantly. Also the loading when changing screen is annoying.","This is a very efficient platform with a big future. I have been very pleased with the rate at which improvements are made to any bugs. I can send and receive my tokens at a fast pace, as well as a strong sense of security. The layout of the wallet is designed expertly in the sense that it's simple to digest and maneuver. The vision that the team with SparkPoint has for the project is exciting beyond words right now. I am very excited for future announcements and added utility with this project.","App is very clean and easy to use, similar to other wallets. Works very fast and smooth. Everytime you change screen, you need to log in again (like in the bank apps) which I feel much more comfortable for security reasons. Overall very satisfied with the interface and looking forward for the following developments!","So far I can confirm that I didn't have any big issues with SparkPoint Wallet and I hope they will keep the higher safety and security standards in future and we will not be lost or stolen our cryptocurrencies. For me SparkPoint wallet is one of the best choses to keep your cryptocurrencies in safe and secure way... So, I recommend it. I love this project as a whole, and I believe huge things are coming through this Wallet!","Great App Designs, Great User Interface, and with the least Hussle. Covered both BEP-20 TOKENS and ERC-20 TOKENS so I can say it supports most of the Tokens you can find in the exchange. From the wallet itself you're able to connect to the whole SPARK ecosystem which is very great."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.sparkpoint","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sparkpoint&hl=en&gl=au"}
