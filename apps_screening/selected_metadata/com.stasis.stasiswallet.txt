Eurs to usdt or usdc exchange facility is also expected in forthcoming update of the app.","Why i can't log in my account? I have my recovery key but when i log in to the app it keeps me waiting. Still loading within 1 hour of waiting. Please fix this.","After depositing USDC into this wallet it will not allow me to send the USDC, it is essentially held hostage in the app, every time i try to send no matter how small the denomination i get an error stating i have insufficient funds available. EDIT - So after receiving this message from the developer, i transferred a tiny amount of ETH to my wallet amd afterward was able to send the USDC, thanks!","App declares 'insufficient funds' when attempting to exchange EURS for btc or eth. Good thing I only transferred a small amount to the wallet to check, as those funds are essentially cut off unless they fix this","Simple and friendly user, Hope can add more alt coin as option"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.stasis.stasiswallet","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stasis.stasiswallet&hl=en&gl=au"}
