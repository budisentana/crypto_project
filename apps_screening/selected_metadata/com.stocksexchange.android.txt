My verification faild 5 to 6 times and they didn't even mention the reason. Talked to the support, They don't care about you.","Really loving the new vibrant color update with the dark theme very nice on the eyes, overall one of the best Crypto Exchanges out there, been using this for almost a year now with no issues","Stex is forever my favourite. Genuine exchange where we trade with ease of mind. The application is fantastic and I use it for my trading activities. No need to sit behind a desktop. We take STEX with us wherever we go. 5 star not enough to STEX a genuine cryptocurrency exchange. Many many stars . ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ","Very Bad update, working very slow, Showing rate Didn't match with other exchanger, Didn't complete order.... So annoying..... Bad experience...","Decent crypto platform, offers a good app but allows trade bots which is a little frustrating but common on crypto. still a all out A rating"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.stocksexchange.android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stocksexchange.android&hl=en&gl=au"}
