Am giving 3 stars for now cos am still waiting for my cash out to arrive. I will give 5 stars and üëç when i get it because it's been a day plus now. And i hope the developer would do something about it.","It said wallet so I assumed it meant 'Wallet'. Very nice starting out but it's simply an 'earn Bitcoin' app not a cryptocurrecy walletüòì","I used it, did all it says. I requested for a payout almost a week now and nothing has been done about it. It's just a waste of time and resources. Please DON'T install but if you did, don't bother using it because it's worthless just delete it.","I think the app is fake because i can't claim energy anymore. Please Google store should try and remove it from the store because they scamming people with it.","Whenever the energy is finished you can't claim no matter how many emails you write to claim energy they don't respond."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.thinkdevs.cryptomarket","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thinkdevs.cryptomarket&hl=en&gl=au"}
