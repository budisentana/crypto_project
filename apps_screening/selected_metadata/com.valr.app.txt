But It would be nice to see price action on the 24hr against ZAR and not Bitcoin or Ethereum. If Coinbase can do it I don't see why it can't be done locally.

I have written two emails to the support asking for assistance but only got the response that \"They are closing my ticket because they haven't heard from me\" this is so frustrating. I'm not a pro in trading but it was easy to see if I have made a profit or a loss at Glace. Please bring back the totals. Thank you","Very user friendly, good reaction and transaction time.
