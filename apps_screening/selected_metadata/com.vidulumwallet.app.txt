They just added Etho. Multiple Interest coins and its rewarded daily. Definitely easy to use.","Slow as hell. Terrible security policy. Awful interface. Can't send crypto. Can't export keys.","Just Amazing! Excellent wallet with Extra long arithmetical pin except the classic 2FA option and the pass. It hosts some of the best \"underground\" Projects like BITCOINZ, Digibyte , Ritocoin and Snowgem , except the classics like btc and eth. It is offering even V-staking rewards for some of these Coins like BitcoinZ and Snowgem (you get VDL coins for holding BTCZ for example) and tipping functions as well ! Congratulations!","Amazing non custodial cryptocurrency wallet with swap technology embedded as well. Nice UI for easy maneuver within the app. Multiplatform accessible and also developers provide 24/7 support on their discord community. I bet y'all would love it when you try it as well. Kudos team","Easy to use and has all the coins I like to mine. The Vidulum wallet has the major projects too. They are adding new coins and with the in wallet exchange service I can swap certain coin pairs also. I love this wallet!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.vidulumwallet.app","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vidulumwallet.app&hl=en&gl=au"}
