Some coins do work, like Bitcoin, but BCH was transferred to this wallet and even after checking the block explorer and seeing that there were 50 confirmations, still no log of the transfer even after 7 hours. People in the U.S. need to keep track of this for tax purposes but it's not too reliable. I'm not sure about all of the coins but LTC is another one that should be examined. Thanks.","Works well keeping in mind its Binance on the Binance blockchains. It does Ethereum Mainnet as well, but will not allow DEX between blockchains. Also will not allow swap between blockchains. So if you have ETH or USDT and want BTC (or visa versa) this will not work for you. Otherwise it is a nice wallet that pays interest on a few held assets (mostly BNB).","It would be the perfect wallet if it had more Binance Smart Chain coin swap options. Dapp browser conflicts with Android Web View sometimes causing loading of exchanges to slow down immensely. Support for ease of access to exchanges is incredible and top quality. In App Price chart is slow to reflect real-time value and tends to lag behind the real time value of coins 9/10 times. In App buy minimum to fund the wallet is painfully high most times. Suggest sending funds to wallet from elsewhere","So far My experience using the trust wallet app has been very good I must admit.... BUT, BUT, BUT your continuous habit of deleting users transaction history/ID everytime the app is updated is a big FAILURE , y'all really need to find a solution to this issue... There isn't any backup feature which allows TX history/ID to be saved & this can be a big issue for many users from different parts of the globe.... As a early user of TW having access to my TX history/ID is very important .... Pls Fix","I was initially a little upset with Trust Wallet because of some issues I was having, but they have great customer service! Now that I know how to fully use the app, it is very easy and I like it. Edit: I lowered my review to 3 stars. I have used a lot of crypto apps and this is definitely the most difficult one to use. I also have lost a lot of crypto while sending it through them."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.wallet.crypto.trustapp","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wallet.crypto.trustapp&hl=en&gl=au"}
