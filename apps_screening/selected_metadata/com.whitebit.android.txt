I made a 55$ transaction from binance to this platform but they told me they dont support ERC-20 so i asked for a refund and they refused. If you care about your money uninstalll this app immediately","The app is fine but the exchange overall doesn't give you clear information. Trading for POODL has been paused, my funds are sitting in my account, and I can't even trade my own funds! Meanwhile I watch the market move everyday so it's extremely frustrating. They have said for weeks they will restart trading but refuse to give a date. If you ask them on telegram this guy Igor will immediately put you on mute! For asking about your own money, it's infuriating!!","Was good, but slow with verification and now when I put my log in details in, the login button doesn't work meaning I can't access my account through the app. Edited. Still slow with verification, but log in issues fixed. Don't know what you did but it works. Nice one","I just updated my app and to my surprise, I can't login again. After inputing my login details, the login tab refuse to come onðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡. Now I can only login through the web which I prefer the app to. Please do something about it quickly.","can't login. \"network timeout\" error in new update"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.whitebit.android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.whitebit.android&hl=en&gl=au"}
