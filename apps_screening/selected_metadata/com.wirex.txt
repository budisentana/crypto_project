We’ve made some under-the-hood changes that make Wirex smarter, better, faster and more secure.","comments":["Haven't had any issues yet - I do want to say that this platform seems a little boring and a bit too plain in terms of being a crypto wirex card - wished we could stake on these types of cards to get specific rewards. Cash back is not convincing enough for me to even buy. I'd rather stake in lock in some of my balances and let it grow. I hardly ever use my card for online shopping purposes - but it'll be nice to be able to stake all coins purchased for 30 days, 60, days or 90 days instead","During 2 weeks can't use the app. Error: \"Sorry, we are currently experiencing technical difficulties. Please try again later or contact Customer Support for assistance\". Developers did not solve the issue. Update: the issue was solved, now the app works on Xiaomi :)","used to be great, but after switching to the new debit card, the 'smart exchange' feature is awful. no control of which currency will be used for the payment. in my case, it tends to use the least desireable one. please, bring back the user control.","I honestly don't know what has happened, I went to put money in to purchase card since Sunday nz/time and it's still saying pending last night they refund the money back so I went to put in again and it's still saying pending payment, but payment has already gone out of my bank account, I need help to find out what has happened.","Thieves. Ridiculous account fees to even transfer between accounts on their own platform. Made one single transaction to another wallet totalling LESS than $4.00NZD after purchasing bitcoin as that is the maximum they would allow - wallet was then cleared entirely. No means of account statements nor where it has gone. No explanation. Would not use this company at all. Remediation non existent.
