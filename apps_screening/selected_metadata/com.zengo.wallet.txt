Much wow. Very coin. ","comments":["ease to buy hold and send crypto, safe secure and simple for me ,helpful customer support, good to learn how crypto apps work the fees ect. even there are sometimes some charges are worth a bit extra and the orders go through quite fast .Good teamwork and effort to assist customer with questions .Thanks .","Updated review: the issue I previously had with the savings has now been resolved, with good CS. Beautiful UX with just one star off for some minor bugs, that are only bothersome sometimes, otherwise don't effect the overall usage of the app/wallet. If you want a simple, trustworthy wallet to buy, trade, earn or simply just store your crypto (and I've tried a few) I so far would recommend ZenGo for sure.","So far I think the app/service is well done, I like the layout and it's easy to navigate. Unfortunately I don't believe this is the crypto app for me, mostly because the minimum is $100 and that's just way more than I'm willing to spend, although that's more of a person finance issue and not their fault, it's just a shame. Other than that, I would say the biggest (CON) for me is the app will say oops error and I have to close and reopen, in order to go back to where I was.","I love the support handle a transactional issue. They did it with the utmost expertise and best customer service ever on an app involving cryptocurrency. The issue was resolved in less than 2 working days. In addition, the app is user friendly and allow you to get interest on your bitcoin or stake your ethereum in a smart contract. And everyone benefits from the referral program. Overall, I would recommend ZenGo to all my friends.","Great App, and Supporting team was very kind and active to resolve the issues in very short spam of time. Thank you Mr Gaurav."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.zengo.wallet","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zengo.wallet&hl=en&gl=au"}
