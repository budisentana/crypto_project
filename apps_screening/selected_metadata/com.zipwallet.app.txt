I can't send bitcoin because it keeps crashing when I press the send button. Also on different device it says insufficient funds not matter how much, or how little you send so you can't do anything. Very poor. And why you can't use same functionality on web, at least to mitigate the shortcomings of the app. Now my bitcoin is sitting there losing value cause I can't send it.","Customer support service NON responsive, I don't advise anyone to use this service, totally appalling. Mobile money transfer that's supposed to take 48hrs has taken 1 month. Bunch of scammers!ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜  Lost about $280","i cant log in it always says update","I've so far made several transactions with zipwalletpay totalling $2000. All have have been smooth with excellent support. The rates are great and their service has even greatly improved with faster payouts in under 1 hour.","The took my 100$ and now the support is just quite u will never get you're money back Support Team talks to u all the team before u deposit money after u deposit the are avaliable at the own time. You pay 30 $ to use the worse service in the planet the finally sent western union after 3 to 4 days didn't bother to check the names with me knowing very well u can't widraw western union if names wrong. Up Antil now the support team is still quite think twice before using this service Am worried this app is good app but the team who support it behind have anther agenda which the most unprofessional service ever world wide Its been 3 weeks now have not received my money the only worried about my ratings on app store than make sure I get my money. I have finally gave up the can keep the money after sending me a proof for western union that I can't widraw it takes one day to considate a transaction at western union the have not done it till now"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.zipwallet.app","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zipwallet.app&hl=en&gl=au"}
