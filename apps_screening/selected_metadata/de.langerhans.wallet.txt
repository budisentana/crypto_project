This should help with the syncing. The Dogecoin network has been a bit overwhelmed with the influx of new users. Work to improve this is being done as we speak. This isn&#39;t really a problem with this app, so bear with it ;)<br>- Fixed calculation of fees. No more stuck transactions because of low fees!<br>- Updated checkpoints to massively reduce the amount of syncing for new and recently created and restore wallets.<br><br>DON&#39;T USE FOR MINING POOL OR FAUCET PAYOUTS!","comments":["Synchronised in reasonable time to show my balance from a backup a few months ago. Sent a test amount to my binance wallet and was there in about half an hour. Did the rest after and it transferred in minutes. If you know what you're doing, have good internet, and understand there can be strain on the network, then you'll be fine with this app.","I had processed a send coin order to one of my addresses, the transfer has not yet taken place. It has been 3 months and the transfer has not been completed yet. All I see is a message \"Currently payments are not possible because a replay is in progress\". I fear my coins will be stuck in this wallet forever.","Wallet is 10 weeks behind. My coin disappeared. Maybe ill see it when the blocks catch up. Good thing I only sent a small amount to test waters. I sent from Gemini. Was extra careful to make sure I copied the correct receiving wallet. If it takes this long to put money into the wallet, could only imagine if I wanted to take it out EDIT: Took full day for blocks to update. Suspect from recent addition of doge into Gemini. Worthy of additional stars. Still recomened other, diverse wallets","Does not sync in background, even when running. App support email is full and returning messages (was able to get a responseon Twitter though). Dev claims to have fixed, but my money is still stuck. \"Fixed calculation of fees. No more stuck transactions because of low fees!\"","Useless app. I could not send dogecoin to any wallet. It is stored there. Whenever I request to send they give the answer that payment now is not possible. This is the answer I get from them since March 2021. Even I don't want to give one star. But no way."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"de.langerhans.wallet","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.langerhans.wallet&hl=en&gl=au"}
