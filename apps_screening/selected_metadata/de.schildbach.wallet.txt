Touchy if it gets touched in the corner or so your BTC, QR, bcode. Scanner could be sent out too who ever .","Been using this wallet for years and always works well, but the fee calculation selection UX could be better","Tremendous fees. Use coinbase! They at least will let you earn some crypto for learning about it. When I want to spend £5 in this app I have to pay £5 fee or set the economy fee which will make you to wait about a month to go through.","Not bad would be a even more awsome if it had a free btc miner with in it","Gone! I had transferred money from coinbase into this app. It was instant. I just opened the app which is about 2 weeks later, and it says I have $0. WTH? There was only about $120 in there, but what is going on? I copied my address and pasted it in blockchain and there's no record of any bitcoin sent or received to my address."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"de.schildbach.wallet","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.schildbach.wallet&hl=en&gl=au"}
