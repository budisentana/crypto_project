Doesn't remember my email or name! I've used this same email address for 15+ years. 4-29-21 Response to developer: it was for 61.07863111 DOGE, sent on 4-22-21 at 6:40pm and 48 seconds. 6-2-21 Response to dev: Keeps saying an error occurred when I put in the code from my cell phone #!!! Such a headache! Link doesn't help!!!","Had an issue with Doge withdraw, but contacted support they were able to help, I think is a very nice wallet, I only wish there was an option for us to mine the transactions, that would really help a lot.","Can you at least get something do to what I have complained about almost a year.. I can't access my wallet.. I'm getting an error message when I want to login.. if it does login the app would go blank..","Lost my access and support helped reset my account. Though the process requires a lot to prove your the owner, otherwise a quick response from the support team","They will lock your account and there is no recovery mechanism, so basically stealing your money. Have tried contacting many times, get sent in circles, then ghosted."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"doge.org.freewallet.app","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=doge.org.freewallet.app&hl=en&gl=au"}
