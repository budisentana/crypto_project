On top, it's lean and mean; less than 9MB demonstrates good coding practice and hints at a professional team and attitude. It's just a bit weird that there is no obvious way to exit or logout from the app other than killing it from the recently used apps list. Am I missing something?","Easy to use and good for transfer money.","Great wallet with great features","Great app. Best money gateway.","Great.. just reserve a star for more to come.
