My connection is ok, the app is faulty.","Horrible! Verification process took almost 2 months. After my papers were verified I asked for a withdrawal 3 months ago and still didn't got my withdrawal approved, always pending. I am pretty sure that this s****y app just wants us to send our papers so they can have our data for nothing (yes, they promise a giveaway with instant withdrawal but the facts tell us otherwise). I regret so much for giving them my identification papers. Please don't do this mistake too!","My got very poor experience with this exchange. In description of application they says, \"Withdrawal is Instant\". But, My withdrawal request is pending from 7 days. And support is not replying at all.","after 3 weeks of waiting to get verified, i go to the app which takes me directly to the browser to sign in. then it takes me to the app after ive signed in. i am trying to upload my ID and it says theres no internet connection. which i have. i cant even withdraw the money i earned. then a box pops up saying that the site is currently dosn but i can verify through my app. I alrwasy have it though and i cant verify through there","I was recommended by my friends and after downloading, I'm so suprised, The design is very nice and the tools are easy to use.
