And more over withdrawal is very very easy. Commission rates are very less wen compaired to other trading apps. What I liked most is after withdrawal from GBBIT acc to ur bank account, money will be transferred in few mins, that's awesome and two way verification approval. I liked the most of secured withdrawal. Ur trading money is secure all the time. Any problems you mail to GBBIT they vll reply ASAP. Customer support","2* for the bug when i tried to sign up.
