You can get your tokens and trade but to get them out is so far impossible. The security is flawed, when you request a withdrawal the system advises you to set up Google Authenticator which never binds, each time you try to get it set up you have to wait 24 hours before you can check if it successfully binded. When you ask for help they say it's not bound and you should try again and they send you steps that don't resolve","Well, the app seems to be working fine, now. Order executions are fast again. Though, I've had issues not being able to sell some new tokens for several days in a row and I haven't tried to withdraw anything yet. So, at that point, my overall experience with this exchange is fairly limited to make a full judgment. But I still put my 5 stars because I do like the app and all the features in it. Happy trading everyone!","My initial review of this app was low do to a lost deposit and lack of response. That has been rectified, so I am changing my review. Use with caution though. They are vastly overwhelmed by new interest in cryptocurrencies by the masses. As are most of the crypto exchanges. Bithumb at least gives a damn. Some do not.","Seriously the Support isn't responsive haven't logged into my account for 3 months now after I lost my authentication key they have asked for information including Identity Cards and Pictures to show am the owner of the account Uptill now the account hasn't been worked on this is so annoying","So lazy and slow response... They take years for completing any transaction, so worst app and mgt...they need it fast and helpful for customers"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"global.bithumb.android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=global.bithumb.android&hl=en&gl=au"}
