Very nice setup and buying is easier than most<< UPDATE after algorand was taken from friends wallet. I hate to see someone go through what I went through, but it seems if you have your money taken, it's tough luck and there isnt any help, use these wallets with knowing you can lose your money...I'm getting away from this wallet learned a bad lesson again. These wallets are not secure...and I am stuck having to use exchanges","Don't put your money in the account. Their support asks for your backup phrase in order to provide support and then takes out the money. When I tried to transfer my funds, it gave me a message to try again in 5-10 minutes. Meanwhile, they transfered the funds to a mysterious account. Now they deny that they would never ask for backup phrase. At this point, I would suggest to stay away from this wallet. Their security sucks and doesn't provide any support to save your funds.","I definitely like this wallet and the limited staking options. I like having my coins together and access to the private keys. I like being able to trade an an acceptable number of pairs, albeit pricey. I dont like that when i go to look at my portfolio balance its off by like 2-3 weeks of price changes. If my valuation changed, i want to know asap. As such, i just cant keep using it and have resorted to calculating my portfolio with excel...","2225.53 pdot appearing in balance everytime I login to the app. Then disappears after 1-2 minutes. This is happening since last 1 week everyday. I never bought or stored pdot ever. I see in the comments that identical issue has been reported by another user few days back. Please check why is this glitch with pdot impacting multiple users. This is ruining the confidence with your app.","I've had the wallet for 5 months now and it has many positives: lots of coins, staking and an exchange partner. So far my experience has been very good. There's been hiccups along the way but resolved in a reasonable time."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"io.atomicwallet","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.atomicwallet&hl=en&gl=au"}
