I gave it 4 stars because it is not completely perfect to use and navigate, transaction history does not reflect all the transactions made by me whether it is sending or receiving coins and I wish the notifications of this app is working or is it just me because I am using an older version of android 8. I hope you can fix this and overall it is a good app not great.","Great customer support but app lacks features!!! The main flaw in this app is that your crypto is in share terms so no value is shown. So no way to add up all your value in the wallet. So you don't know what your crypto is doing in your dollar amount. Just a (-3.00%) shown When you stake something your not given a special location to find the coin, you have to hunt for it You need to have eth to do anything like redeeming your rewards so watch out! Im really disappointed in cosmos...","Great app, easy to use. So many nice features. Could use some added features. It's hard to know what your total returns on investments is since it doesn't keep track of where you stared. Haven't had great success in identifying if I've made anything on my staking crypto either. Over its good, but some room for improvement.","This has got to be the worst crypto wallet I've ever used. Tons of bugs and glitches, complicated staking procedures, and the fees are very high. On top of that I lost coins due to a problem with the wallet and customer service is simply incapable of understanding my problem or helping. My advice would be to stay away from this app.","Great app for a beginner, such as myself. More up and coming coins need to be added. The ability to sell and trade coins directly thru the wallet would make it the best on the market. And if you really want to solidify #1 spot, bring the community of AWC users together like they've done on my favorite trading platform."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"io.atomicwallet","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.atomicwallet&hl=en&gl=au"}
