Moonpay does not work plus you have to register again. After entering email moonpay sends verification code but when you minimize window to access email for code you lose all progress with moonpay so you have to start the process again hitting the same problem. It is impossible to buy through this system. Why can't you give us thechoice of whether we want to use moonpay or use credit/debitcard. cannot buy so usel","Lightning is custodial and thus risky and very difficult to debug when there's a problem. For instance they upgraded to newer version and payments stopped working, took me quite a while to figure it out. The UI is very laggy, payments take long time to show up in the UI.","Problems to open the app. It freezes after I put my fingerprint. When the app opens, sometimes it also freezes and I have to close it and open it. Otherwise, nice interface and good features to link to btc and lightning node","Been using it for 10 min. Got it connected to my node but I can fill my wallet from my node not sure what up there but more importantly it has locked up 7 or 8 times already. First test fund can be seen on chain but disappeared in app. Techsupport: \"looks fine here\""],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"io.bluewallet.bluewallet","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.bluewallet.bluewallet&hl=en&gl=au"}
