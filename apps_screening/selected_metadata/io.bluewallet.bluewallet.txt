I have tried it all. Cache delete, deleted the app, re installed it and so on. What a pity","Wallet fine. Using the lightning wallet. I backed up my wallet but it wouldn't let me take a screen shot of the bk up qr code so had to manually write it down. When using the export/ back up in the wallet settings it never loads, just loads forever spinning :/ My mate couldn't take a screen shot on his phone either.","It was 5. But then i found that using my old phone i cannot restore my wallet offline. This app requires even dedicated cold storage phone to be ONLINE during wallet restoration. I can't trust this app to handle my private keys. I am going back to electrum for now.","Useless, was great could buy with credit card but now you have to pay with moonpay. Moonpay does not work plus you have to register again. After entering email moonpay sends verification code but when you minimize window to access email for code you lose all progress with moonpay so you have to start the process again hitting the same problem. It is impossible to buy through this system. Why can't you give us thechoice of whether we want to use moonpay or use credit/debitcard. cannot buy so usel","Lightning is custodial and thus risky and very difficult to debug when there's a problem. For instance they upgraded to newer version and payments stopped working, took me quite a while to figure it out. The UI is very laggy, payments take long time to show up in the UI."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"io.bluewallet.bluewallet","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.bluewallet.bluewallet&hl=en&gl=au"}
