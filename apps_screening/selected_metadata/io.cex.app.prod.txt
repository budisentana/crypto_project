Time wasters Update: they then lock the account down and now say I have failed verification even though I have met all requirements. The app is one of the worst apps I've ever used.","The withdrawal minimum, shady, is not exactly standout. You will miss it, that's how it was set up. a sticky note on a back of a page. Note the headline.. lol. Also minimum input is half the minimum withdrawal. Btc Min deposit 0.01 33$ Min withdrawal .002 (50$) Fee .ooo5 17$. one way to steal transaction leftover sums. policy does not supercede law. Everyone else offers a way. Advice: be careful low return margin staking compared to everyone. high fee margin in comparison to all.","Gift card can be used to purchase crypto. My months long search is finally over. Dozens of kyc and no other btc desk could utilize the form of payment I was electing to use. This and the app itself is sleek, minimal, very functional, and safe.
