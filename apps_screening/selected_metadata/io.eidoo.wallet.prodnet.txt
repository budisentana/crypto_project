Eventhough app performs well, you need to take care of other solutions as ETH seems not be a viable option due to its high fees. Most of the comments were about this.

Projects with so many users and srill very bad user exxperience","Very high fees... Transferred ethereum twice paying high fees and even after that app says insufficient balance to transfer tokens. Neither it displays how much ether is required to transfer specific tokens. The swap features also require very high fees.","Entrapment. They want (at this time) $350+/- of ETH gas to move or swap $200 of LEND to Aave or ETH. UPDATE: I transfered $25 of ETH to eidoo for gas and sent the Lend to the same eth address (coinbase) , and it's gone. Now no ETHlend/aave or ETH. All are eth20 tokens. All are gone.
