Good idea god UI, but now it's totally frozen on splash screen, it doesn't even allow me to login. Please fix that soon!","Was excited about using this wallet, but I can't even get past the Hello! Create a login passcode screen as the number buttons are unresponsive :-/","This is another Bitcoin type App that totally SUCKS it takes forever & I mean that we spent 5 hours on this crazy, makes no sense at all about how to use the App!!! Trying to follow the instructions makes you extremely frusterated bcuz they don't make it very easy at all to understand what you are supposed to do! So HEAR MY MESSAGE AND INSTAL AT YOUR RISK!!!!! Excuse me, but if you were going to take the time to reply to me. Then why wouldn't you at least help me out with ALL OF THE PROPLEMS?","They respond when you contact","Great novel recovery concept"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"io.hexawallet.hexa","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.hexawallet.hexa&hl=en&gl=au"}
