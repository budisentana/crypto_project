It used to be okay, but now it feels like I'm using the beta version of an app that was just introduced. I'm using thw latest version and it has more bugs than an abandoned house. The freezing and crashes are unbearable. Reached out to customer service over a week ago and still no response.","I just lost $500+. A few seconds after I received my funds it was transferred immediately to different account. Never have I ever shared my security phrase nor saved it in my phone. I emailed and still hoping for a reply. If this issue can't be fixed. I'll definitely tell all my friends and post this on social media.","Doesn't give me the proper receiving address for BNB, I have to get it from trust wallet. No matter how I set the defaults I can't properly open links most of the time. They either don't open at all or open in an unsupported browser. The only app I use daily that doesn't have dark mode, and it's all bright white, not sure why this hasn't been addressed. The only reason I stick with it is because there's really not a better option currently.","Good UI and ability to import custom tokens and use custom RPCs. However, due to an issue with the mobile version of metamask I cannot log in to Shopping.io and connect my wallet. I have contacted their customer support and they have exhausted their ability to do anything in the matter as it appears to be a bug in metamask's mobile version itself. If this could be addressed and resolved in a future update I would gladly increase my rating for the app as a whole.","Worst app browser wallet, worst everything. Shorting after downloading metamask and importing my wallet, all my crypro came up missing. Tried contacting metamask support, been over 10 days now and still havent heard back from them. Attempt to use the browser inside the app, and it constantly freezes up. So far every transaction ive made since i added the app to this device has taken my crypto and havent gotten anything in return. Lost over $2,200 , as a direct result of opening a metamask acct"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"io.metamask","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.metamask&hl=en&gl=au"}
