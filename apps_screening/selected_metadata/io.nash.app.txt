Then dictates what sort of password you can use. That's irritating but fine. Does supply you with your backup codes so you do own your coins. It's an otherwise standard wallet. The reason I'm here is because of one stupid feature it has that's unique but shouldn't be. YOU CAN SAVE ADDRESSES AS CONTACTS. It's like being the guy that invented windows in houses or something. Now if it just let you make monthly transfers to those addresses.","This is the most secure wallet ever. Love the fiat ramps with 0% fee on BTC, ETH & NEO and just 1% on others. The whole time its non-custodial and very user friendly. I've been using this app for quite some time now and can see how hard the team works on it with the speed of updates, it has a great future and all should consider giving it a try. 5*","Just uninstalled the app, it's has a very poor UX with touch targets that are way too small and misleading trading limits that change right after you start inputing numbers."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"io.nash.app","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.nash.app&hl=en&gl=au"}
