I ll check it few days if you improve the app I ll change my rating... But honestly very low class app this one compare to others ...","It's a stupid dumb app. I've been struggling with it for around 2 months. It's just being advertised on the B4U website, but I haven't been able to mine a single cent. Before launching a product it goes through a trial phase. But these people are only interested in launching new products and services without ever planning how to maintain them."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"io.rscoins.network","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.rscoins.network&hl=en&gl=au"}
