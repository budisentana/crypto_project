Super excited. Been waiting for this since I got my safePal. Revision: Since update, sushi swap has stopped functioning correctly causing it to default to ERC20 network. Needs a patch asap! Quickswap also experiences lag. Tokens don't appear so no exchanges can be made. Also need a POS bridge to fund polygon through wallet.","The App's interface is cool. I'm currently having a problem interacting with the DApps browser. Pancakeswap and most other swaps are only showing blank pages when they load.","Apparently I forgot my password but I know I've been putting in the right password, tried importing to a different device with the right seed phrase and a whole brand new wallet without my Money showed up different address, Now I have no access to the wallet because it says my password is wrong and the seed phrase isn't linking my wallet. This app gets a big FAT 0 because now I'm broke and need my money and I can't access it. Bout to call the FTC and CFPB","Safe Haven (SHA) tokens from the Vechain Blockchain is not working on the safepal App. When you send SHA tokens from safepal, Transaction keep failing. It has been like that for a long time. Please FIX!","Love this Wallet! My original hardware got stolen, and got my replacement. Easy seed word restoration.
