Also provide a update feature which means you can keep up with latest information about the application. üòéüòÉ","This app is a thive. They tried to take your token e very day. And when you transfer you lost your token. Support Never reply your email forever. I lost my token and my brother loss all token. They said some one sent your coin uot and you can get back. That mind this app easy to hack","Can't type numbers in Pancake Swap App. I've uninstalled the App but same issue after reinstalling. PLEASE FIX.","I love this wallet. Easy to use and great at everything. It connects easily to their hardware wallet if you have one but the app works on its own too. The hardware wallet is the best on the market in my opinion. My only minor gripe about the phone wallet is that you can look at the contract address for a token but you can't copy it for pasting elsewhere.","my expereinc with safepal app is extremely bad ..i reset my phone and installed safepal again . restored the wallet using secret keywords . it was sucessfull but my sfp coins became zero now...from 76.5 to zero . i have raised an case with safepal team (16372) but no response."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"io.safepal.wallet","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.safepal.wallet&hl=en&gl=au"}
