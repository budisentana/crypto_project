{"title":"Smart Secure Wallet - SmartHoldem STH Coin","description":"Introducing the SmartHoldem Secure Mobile Cryptocurrency Wallet.\r\n\r\nIt Begins with Total Security\r\nWe built the SmartHoldem Mobile Wallet foundation on top-of-the-line security architecture, combined our UX/UI and development experience, and went above and beyond to make a Mobile Wallet that can turn your smartphone into a secure wallet like a hardware wallet.\r\n\r\nSecure Access\r\nThe SmartHodem Mobile Wallet uses two completely independent layers of cryptography to protect the keystore and confidential data.\r\nFunds are safely secured with AES-256 encryption and custom selected PIN.\r\n\r\nFor maximum security, the ability to create a second secret passphrase has been added. When creating a second secret passphrase, you must know 2 passphrases in order to access your wallet.\r\n\r\nPin-code\r\nWe built our Pin-code that stops any form of data sniffing or keyloggers. The Pin-code is built into the wallet itself with ability to custom selected Pin-code for the ultimate level of wallet protection. The Pin-code is converted to a SHA-384 hash and encrypts itself using AES algorithms.\r\n\r\nEasy Access\r\nQuick and easy access to your STH coins, anytime, anywhere with the SmartHoldem Mobile Wallet.\r\n\r\nSmart by Design\r\nThe SmartHoldem Mobile Wallet is designed for simple & fast coin management. Streamlined navigation. Amazing responsive design and new features!\r\n\r\nVote for Delegates\r\nWith the STH Mobile Wallet you can search delegates, become a delegate, or vote for a delegate and more. 64 delegates underpin, secure and maintain SmartHoldem's Public Network using a DPoS consensus mechanism.\r\n\r\nImport Wallets\r\nAll your SmartHoldem addresses all in one place. Import your wallets, create new directly from the online wallet or add the wallets you are working with to your contact list and get quick access.\r\n\r\nMemory Encryption\r\nData is held in encrypted memory and any important values are instantly deleted from memory after processing.\r\n\r\n12 Words or Tell me a verse\r\nIn case your device gets lost or you forget your password, you can restore your wallet and funds with just 12 - 24 words (mnemonic code for generating deterministic keys BIP 39) written on paper. Also SmartHoldem Wallet is the first in the world to support the generation of mnemonic code for generating deterministic keys in Russian (https://github.com/smartholdem/bip39).\r\n\r\nYou can use your favorite verse or line from a song as a password so you don’t write the words on paper. It became possible thanks to the support of the generation deterministic keys.\r\n\r\nWhile the Mobile wallet is an integral part of the STH platform’s ecosystem, we did not build a cryptocurrency wallet that’s just for STH users.\r\nWe built a Mobile wallet for everyone — traders, holders and other cryptocurrency projects included.\r\nThe SmartHoldem Mobile Wallet supports BTC, BTS, LTC, DOGE, ETH, MDL, NVC, POST, BitCNY, BitUSD.\r\n\r\nThe SmartHoldem Mobile Wallet does not rely on any 3rd party services or block explorers.This powers the SmartHoldem Mobile Wallet with detailed transaction information and other great features from SmartHoldem Blockchain Explorer blockexplorer.smartholdem.io","descriptionHTML":"Introducing the SmartHoldem Secure Mobile Cryptocurrency Wallet.<br><br>It Begins with Total Security<br>We built the SmartHoldem Mobile Wallet foundation on top-of-the-line security architecture, combined our UX/UI and development experience, and went above and beyond to make a Mobile Wallet that can turn your smartphone into a secure wallet like a hardware wallet.<br><br>Secure Access<br>The SmartHodem Mobile Wallet uses two completely independent layers of cryptography to protect the keystore and confidential data.<br>Funds are safely secured with AES-256 encryption and custom selected PIN.<br><br>For maximum security, the ability to create a second secret passphrase has been added.
