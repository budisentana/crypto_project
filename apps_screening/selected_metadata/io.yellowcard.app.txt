It's been more than 3 weeks. I messaged support and what they always say is that the development team has been reached to get it solved. Yet nothing. Deserves a negative star. Just very frustrating. Bad bad bad. Even with a password reset, I am unable to use the new password. Wish I never downloaded it.","My experience with Yellowcard is very frustrating. I am unable to paste my wallet address after copying it for the last 5 days. I have written several emails and I have done everything that they have asked me to do and still 5 days later nothing has been done! They don't care if you are late with payments that you need to do or if you have to pay a fine because of late payments because they are unable to fix a problem. I hate this App!!ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡","The App works great when you deposit your money, the problem comes on withdrawls. I have email what they call YellowCard support team for more than 5 days telling them the same thing, last week Thursday they told me that the refunding or reversing process has already started so I have to wait for 48-72 hours but till now nothing happened. If I email them all they can tell me is that \"the financial team is busy working on it \". This app disappointed me ðŸ’”ðŸ’”ðŸ’”.please refund my money ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡","I have long downloaded the app, I haven't experienced any problems, Yellow Card is the easiest and cheapest where you can deposit, buy or sell your cryptocurrency without any problem. As long as you know how part of it. I want to argue my fellow countrymen, from Botswana that with Yellow Card you'll not struggle since you just do your deposits from a local bank for free. I fully recommend that you open your wallet with Yellow Card. Thank you.","Am editing my review...but still don't deserve 5 star cuz when u try to log in you don't receive an SMS.. but I think watsapp worked .. also a poor customer support.. but at list I got my account back..."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"io.yellowcard.app","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.yellowcard.app&hl=en&gl=au"}
