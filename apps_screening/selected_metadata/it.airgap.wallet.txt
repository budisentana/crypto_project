Had to try for two days to get my funds back to my binance address then it randomly decided to work. Most functionalities are not working, I kept getting errors that I have insufficient funds even though funds were clearly there. I tried 10 times to get my eth out of this mess and some times I even received an error saying something about Tezos. Even their error messages are problematic.","Fees for some reason are crazy high it doesn't make sense as I don't see the same for other wallets. And when I do try to send it keeps giving me error saying not enough balance when I do have sufficient balance. Nice concept with the Airgap Vault and Wallet but I'd avoid if you want this to be your main wallet. Go for something that supports SegWit","Great concept, poor execution. Bugs in the Polkadot wallet means a) I can't transfer my full balance from the wallet and b) it doesn't look like transactions go through at all. Would not recommend.","I tested this wallet and really works well. Still some work to be done to improve on the wallets performance. Connects well with offline phone vault feature and sent btc out 3 times to another wallet all confirmed. Thanks for this wallet really appreciate the hard work you put into it so far. Hope you will sort the vault wallet out for marshmallow soon.","Great concept. Still has rough edges. When I get bitcoin, the wallet doesn't need to show me how big the chunk was that it came from.. Very weird. Chunk: meaning, the tx that sent utxo Also address reuse from what I recall... almost like your devs don't use or understand Bitcoin best practices which is understandable considering Xtz, Eth, Eos all function that way."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"it.airgap.wallet","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.airgap.wallet&hl=en&gl=au"}
