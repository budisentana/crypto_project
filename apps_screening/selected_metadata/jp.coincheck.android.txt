The AI for this process is terrible and it seems as if they do not even have a customer support team to jump in and help. If you can find another app I highly recommend it.","27May2021 New updated design not feel better then older. ＊Older version was very good → easy to watch / big font /big chart /portfolio & amount one page. #Need Improve → #Portfolio page must be + -￥00000 how much we + profit or - loss sign → like Bitflyer. And When Bitcion buying/selling coin rate history same chart not transaction history, same as like Bitflyer. Bitflyer is better to watch portfolio buying/selling history. ♯I like Coincheck but need more improvement with more new coins.","The only reason I'm giving this app a star rating is because it's not possible to give a zero star rating. Verification process is hell and it doesn't work at all. Total waste of time. Please take down this app. So Useless.","The interface is too simple, must add more views like website. Also the verification is taking ages, rejected 4 times, while it it was immediate and smooth with bitflyer..."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"jp.coincheck.android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.coincheck.android&hl=en&gl=au"}
