Please answer","5 stars easy to use do not guess Coinpal easy","So I have a person on facebook named rose George trying to get me to join and send them my info on your app. Also your bitcoin cannot be withdrawn which is not okay. And the way you respond to people's reviews is not professional.... (are you a competitor you must be) a competitor won't address you for a free wallet hows can you compete. ðŸ˜‰ I recommend to attempt to scam people another way I will be posting to the facebook page that this is also part of the scam. So yes you get one star."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"me.coinpal.app","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.coinpal.app&hl=en&gl=au"}
