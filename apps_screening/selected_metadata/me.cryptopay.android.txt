I've used cpay wallet and a physical card for 1/2years now. There is a fee for absolutely everything you can do. The support and security for the app has gone beyond down hill lately, it makes me no longer want to use the app. Stick to coinbase or blockchain app.","Convinient App and friendly support! Taxation and rates are not among best possible but acceptable.Some transactions are not visualized but balance is right.","Cryptopay wallet use to be great but inactivity, you have to pay for it, that's a lot of difference from other wallet which are much more convenient. I understand crypto suppose to be trustless which you can use paper wallet if you want to but keeping a wallet which costs for inactivity is the same as banks so might as well keep it in a bank.","Great app, love the fact you can easily exchange the available tokens, and loading the associated card can be done from a token or fiat source, unlike other apps where tokens have to be converted to fiat currency first. Highly recommended.","Its a scam they will hold your money hostage. And deplete it with micro fees and charges until your account is empty. Can't make transfers of less than 0.0001 Bitcoin therefore your micro transactions will not work."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"me.cryptopay.android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.cryptopay.android&hl=en&gl=au"}
