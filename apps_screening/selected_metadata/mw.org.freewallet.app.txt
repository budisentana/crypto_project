We have fixed some minor performance issues to make your experience as smooth as possible. Hope you‚Äôll enjoy it!","comments":["If this is not a scam then at the present time I do not believe they have a support team. Maybe they are just 'busy' but it's been two weeks since I submitted my ticket and I still haven't conversed with a human! Ergo, one star because the app installs. Nothing more as my BTC are still yet to be found since I 'smart' transferred them in. I would avoid this app at the present time based solely on the support experience. [edit] Support ticket#333616 has been responded to - thank you - +1 more star. [edit#2] - you mention refund but the ticket says the partner has all the info and to create a new PAYIN BTC. All very confusing. We will see. [edit#3]. They eventually refunded me, however based on this experience I still cannot recommend nor give > 2 stars - especially when they ask me to edit the review. If I had enough funds I would transfer what little BTC I have elsewhere and close the account.","For the most part I like the app alot. I transferred in out and exchanged numerous times with no problems. It's always worked smoothly before.....I sent 14.9 xrp \"with the correct tag number included\" ......and never recieved the xrp. I submitted a ticket. Waited. Then got an email saying they are backed up on tickets and are trashing all existing open tickets and to submit a new one. I did. It's been a week since I submitted the new one. Costumer Service at freewallet is a joke.","ticket ID is 315537 Update: The customer service officially provided me the things i needed to submit. And i sent their requirements, hopefully i got to access my account, finally. *Ratings may change depends on their response. Update: They fix my problem. Able to redeem my account","Enough with the issues already, or updates or whatever it is. Bottom line it continuously happens, and usually at the worst possible time since losing a lot money. And why? I've never seen another app exchange ever have these issues. The date and time that was requested for payout or exchange should be honored. It was offered to the users as functional, and hasn't been the case on your end as promised.. These excuses are not acceptable. Compensation seems appropriate for start.","Apparently, the WORST app ever. Been trying to sign up since forever. I've re-installed the app severally. Still, the three sign up metheds, mine seem to be pulling through. Google should give option for zero star. Apps like this ain't worth a single star"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"mw.org.freewallet.app","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mw.org.freewallet.app&hl=en&gl=au"}
