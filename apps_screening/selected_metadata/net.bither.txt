Tried several times, and the tried several variations of the only word in the phrase that could have been copied wrong. Good thing I did not have any coins in the saved wallet otherwise I would be destitute. I cannot recommend a wallet that has unreliable account recovery.","Works, but barely does that. This app has given me too many heart attacks to count. With transactions taking upwards of two days to go through, balance not updating when someone's sent me coins, and overall running like a child-developed program rather than an efficient app, this app WILL EVENTUALLY get the job done, but add unnecessary stress to your life in the procsss.","Doesn't work.
