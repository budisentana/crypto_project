Right before I did the authentication to get myself in I saw it in as one of the cryptos. I go through the process and by the time I get done it is not a part of the list anymore.","I hate trying to make a withdrawal after I do a purchase of bitcoin. It nearly always gives me a withdrawal error bout how much I have as an available balance!","I have tried for 1 month to complete registration and always some bugs crop up. Sent many mails to customer service, no feedback.","OK app, I find it awkward to adjust the charts using pinch & zoom. Still very useful & UI simple to use. When logging in after updating password the dark theme resets to light. APP NOT CONNECTING TODAY!
