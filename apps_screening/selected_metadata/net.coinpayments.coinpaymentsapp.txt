I received $20 from somewhere and When am trying to transfer to other wallet charging almost double amount. Asking $38 to transfer $20. No crpto wallpet is charging double and it's not fee it's you people eating money for unknown users. Lost $20 verg bad app stay away from these people.","I try to buy sara bot on jetbot though the app.but i lost almost 90 dollars on coinpayments i am very sad They provide me a link on mail to claim 32 dollar but they dont send txnd which required to claim. I tried to raise a ticket but for that so many hardle i hve to face. TOTALLY SCAMMERS EAT MY MONEY Dont use --------------------------------*rating After submit the review my soul is in peace","Terrible experience. This scam app is easy to recieve the cripto, but very hard to get It back or make any payments over it due to the hidden minimum amount which you can see only before the last step and which is way more then the purchase amount. Have just lost my $15 for nothing. Burn in hell, scamers!","Edit* The app is an absolute joke. CoinPayments support is 50/50 I feel some support agents can be more sarcastic or ignorent than others. To convert your coins you must have £50-£60 worth them which is absurd. To transfer coins the fees extortionate. They say there is no hidden fees etc and its Tx fees but you can send crypto from wallets like Coinbase, Nash & Blockchain without fees that high. I'd recommend any new users to fully avoid CoinPayments unless you want a large %of your crypto gone","I can't access acct. There is no option other then scan qr. This is a joke. .36 short and I'm being strong armed $5 in \"fees\" to make up the amount needed bc btc price went up. So not fair. You guys have it setup so no support is available. This is why majority don't trust crypto bc of bottomfeeders like you take advantage of people.
