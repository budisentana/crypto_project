Merging the digital world with the physical world makes this an app that is both profitable and fun! I highly recommend grabbing the Sentinel Card since it's free for now (except shipping). If you're frequently on the road this could be a serious side hustle! If you're not, it's still fun, lucrative, and free!","So far its been really simple to use and it's been completely free until you want to do something. Then they want to charge. The value to buck isn't worth it yet. I mean it's hard to keep the app to stay on the device that they sell you ain't worth a damn because it's never working in the battery eventually run out and you got to find a battery for it and you're stuck. So far I haven't made 50 Cent $ or a dollar","I hate that auto will turn off by itself, sometimes I forget to check it and when I do the auto has turned off. Also the surveys are just a waist of time for me. Every time I take one with high points it will take me like 15 min to answer all their questions only for them to tell me I'm not fit and only get like 10 points for it instead.","About 60% of the ads don't get credited so it's just a waste of time. I'm waiting on the \"Free card\" that cost $25 postage to see if I'm just wasting my time or time and money. The minigames are extremely repetitive, they need to add some new ones or add a favourite option, some of them are really bad if you have bad eyes for colours.","Great fun! Likes newer phones 7 series or newer. Just noticed my review from almost two years ago. Wow have we come along way!! If I'm moving, I'm mining. Mine them coins and convert them to tokens. Never thought this would pay off the way it has. We are still climbing and and I'm excited for the future. Play and learn. Get yourself a crypto wallet and redeem every chance you get. It may not seem like much when you do, but a pair of Diamond hands will make it grow. Good luck fellow miners."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"network.xyo.coin","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=network.xyo.coin&hl=en&gl=au"}
