{"title":"NEWRICH (NRCH) Cryptocurrency Wallet","description":"Send, Receive and Store NEWRICH (NRCH) Cryptocurrency.\r\n\r\nNEWRICH (NRCH) is built on blockchain technology. A blockchain functions as a secure, public ledger of all transactions on a peer-to-peer network that cannot be tampered with except through the use of an impractically large amount of computing power. A complete copy of the ledger is stored on each node in the network, allowing for such security. Specifically, NEWRICH (NRCH) is built on the Ethereum blockchain in order to achieve a completely decentralized system. The benefits of a decentralized system are numerous.

In a centralized system, if the central node in the network fails, the whole network fails with it. However, in a decentralized system, the network’s data and computational power is distributed among many nodes, requiring a larger number of nodes to fail before the network is seriously impacted by the failures.

Finally, in conjunction with blockchain technology, a decentralized network allows transactions to be independently verified by any node in the network, eliminating the need for trust in a central institution to verify transactions for everyone.
