I tryed several times. My ElectronCash desktop wallet bailed me out. I'd like to report the problem to Electron but that requires signing into Gethub. Hopefully they monitor these reviews. I've got a Samsung Galaxy Halo. Otherwise I'd love to use the app if that kink gets worked out!","Clean and simple wallet app. Reinstall fixed a crashing upon open problem. The option to show fiat value of choice doesnt seem to work, but I am sure will on an update.","Mobile version of the best desktop bitcoin cash wallet. Quite simple, but powerful and transparent mobile bitcoin cash (BCH) wallet.","Not used it to transact yet, but have restored an existing wallet using seed words, and all appears fine.","Really really garbage. UI is not just bad, it's indecipherable, nobody would want to use this, and all the developers on it could really do a better job at everything."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"org.electroncash.wallet","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.electroncash.wallet&hl=en&gl=au"}
