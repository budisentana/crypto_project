I use it as a watch only wallet, was able to rebroadcast my transactions and shows my transactions properly. Biometric authentication would be nice, but on my phone I am able to add it to any app, so it's not something urgent for me.","So far it seems very simple and secure. Iv yet to experience any transactions but will elaborate once that time comes and gain a better knowledge of how it all works.","Downloaded it. Sadly app doesn't even open. Tried to delete and redownload several times with always same result. Have to conclude that app is unusable.","Tried google playstore, app keeps crashing after install. I tried to install the apk from the website. But has issue parsing package...","No easy way to import a wallet of the same program from Windows. You'd think being the same thing would make it more fluid."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"org.electrum.electrum","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.electrum.electrum&hl=en&gl=au"}
