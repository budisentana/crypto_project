I have received and sent Guapcoins with no problems.","I am unable to log in. I tried using the login information from the website and signing up through the app multiple times as well, but never received any verification codes. I have contacted via email, but haven't heard back. Please assist ASAP","Sleek UI with a private key. It's working much better now..","What's going on with this wallet? I sent 2000 coins from probit to my wallet and I haven't received my money into my wallet and it's bn 24 hours. Ok so it's still not showing up in my wallet but when I check my wallet on explorer my 2000 Guap coins show up when I put my wallet address in.
