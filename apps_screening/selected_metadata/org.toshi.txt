I created an account a month ago and mined coin to the wallet address associated to that account. I then got a new phone, dled this app to the new phone and used recovery phrase to log in. It then asked me for a username again for some reason and when i tried the previous username It said it was \"taken\" so I used a new one. The new username seemed to wipe the funds received by the older username even though I used same recoveryphrase.","I've been with Coinbase since 2017, and although the fees might be higher than other exchanges, it's very simple and smooth to use, and I never had any issues with this exchange. I earned free Crypto for simply watching videos, I earn interest on my Crypto, I can borrow, I can transfer easily, and my money is safe. Check out my website for $10 free in Bitcoin once you deposit $100.","This app is slowing down my phone. I have a Pixel 5 that doesn't have much on it. I keep it clean and don't install much. I am in cyber security and know it is not malware. Ever since I installed this app all other apps are painfully slow. I tried to force stop Coinbase Wallet and my phone's performance improved. The performance is still too slow even after stopping the app.","What a joke!!! At first they tell you you're going to get some ridiculously high interest rate by lending out your money, then somehow it ends up under 1%. Mine went from something like 11% down to .44% and has stayed there for months. To top that off the miner fees are so high it's basically impossible to get any of your money out because they're charging almost the same amount you're trying to withdraw. I tried to get something like $100 out and they wanted like 80 or 90% miner fees.","I'm on day two of trying to send coin. App constantly freezes and locks. Money is trapped in app. Crashes constantly. Cannot access coins as soon as they were added. Cannot send or receive."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"org.toshi","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.toshi&hl=en&gl=au"}
