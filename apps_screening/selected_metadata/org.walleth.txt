Any hope for Ledger support via USB?","Overall it looks like a very well designed app. The only issue is that it doesn't work with my trezor. It says in the update that it supports firmware 2.3 but that doesn't seem to be the case. I'm keeping my review at 3 stars until I can probably review the app. It still functions as a native wallet, so if that's what you're after it's amazing.","Excellent, simple, no-nonsense, non-custodial Ethereum client wallet. It's stable, well-built open source software that protects your freedom.","Just started to use the app, and transferred 5 dai to this wallet. I can see them appear and disappear. Is this normal? It seems like a refresh thing. Thanks!","Any idea when 1.9.1 Trezor will be supported? \"For trezor model one only fimrware 1.8.x is suppotred but found 1.9.1 error when connecting to trezor.\" This Error when connecting to Trezor."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"org.walleth","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.walleth&hl=en&gl=au"}
