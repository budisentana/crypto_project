","comments":["Got a new phone. Tried to log in. Followed the verification steps to the letter. Then app freezes. I've been attempting this for a month now on several phones. I came here to check if the reviews would help only to see the same nonsense has been happening to other people. It's obvious you guys know what you're doing and will keep doing it cos it's all virtual. Thieves.","Worst application ever! I transferred coin from trade to private key wallet since 18/06/2021 and till this moment it has not reflected in my account. Transfer of coin from a wallet to another shouldn't take this long considering it's from same application. Coin worth or $3000 is now reducing daily without dropping to any of the wallet. Transaction status remain \"confirming\" for a week now. I have generated several ticket number and still no response at all. New ticket number #2558126.","I can't log into my account i the app. It asks me to verify the login through the email they sent me. I've done that a couple of times. It works with the web version but not with the app. After verifying and coming back to the app, the login process restarts. Please do something about that...","I woke up to one day and found some amounts transferred to an address am not familiar with.. I notified the support team and the best thing they did is give me a ticket... Its been days now and not a word from the team.. Support team you can do better.. At least let me understand how amounts were transferred without my consent... My ticket #2538925","Updating to downgrade from 2 stars to 1. Cannot wait to have Blockchain out of my life. Log in on phone app correctly first time, am told to check email for certification link. Go to email and click link - acc immediately frozen. UTTERLY STUPID ... Confusing. Contradictory. Frustrating. Looks great. Support tickets go unanswered and Live Chat left me hating the company. Seems to be very secure, seamless, efficient in other ways. IE It does the hard things well and some easy things really badly."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"piuk.blockchain.android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=piuk.blockchain.android&hl=en&gl=au"}
