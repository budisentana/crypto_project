I've invited 5 of my friends so far and none of them has been specified as invitation prize or power! What's wrong with this. I remember it used to give you power points for reading and sharing posts. Now all it prizes you for is just getting more and more people into the app. Simply put, it's a SCAM!! DON'T BOTHER INSTALLING!","Where is the read power option in the daily tasks option, it is missing and disappeared from the Pivot App, Why,please tell me the reason and problem,thanks","I am disappointed with Pivot app. Reason:- I referred two persons. But got power only for one person. Not got power for the second referral.","I withdrew my PVT for over a week now and it's still showing pending, I just read about people having the same issue for months. Please don't tell me I wasted years on your app for me to get this kind of treatment. Not cool at all, please fix up","I'm really not happy with this app i withdrew my pvt for months now and it's still pending..kindly please work on it and return my pvt back"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"top.pivot.community","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=top.pivot.community&hl=en&gl=au"}
