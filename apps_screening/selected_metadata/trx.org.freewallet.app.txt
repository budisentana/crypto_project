If it eventually shows up, ill leave my rating. If it never does, hello 1 star. Edit: I will not be pursuing the 3 dollars in tron I lost, if it means contacting staff over a simple first erroneous transaction, I feel I would need to do it again, and again. You can keep my money, and my rating.","I downloaded the app few weeks ago... I wanted to send some trons but i was asked to verify my email. I mistakenly input a wrong email for verification... Alongside me other emails where correct which i received the verification messages in my mails and i verified successfully but i couldn't send the trons saying that onr email has not been verified... And it was the incorrect email that hasn't been verified i tried deleting it but to no avail please rectify this problem ASAP. Good app tho üëåüëç","Purchased some BTT at the beginning of February. 2(two) months later and those money are not in my wallet. Balance zero. Opened a case (276381) at that time and still not sorted out. I would have been better off just throwing money out of the window.","It's been mailing several times without any response from the support team, this is unfair. Pleas help as this is very important, Ticket number: 326865 Edit: The team responded faster and helped me with everything. Thanks so muchüíñ","I downloaded the app and I signed up. After few days it doesn't log in into my wallet. It will just bring the \"P\" like logo then disappear and everything gets black blank. How can this be resolved, it's frustrating. I already transferred some trons to that wallet, can't afford to lose them."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"trx.org.freewallet.app","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=trx.org.freewallet.app&hl=en&gl=au"}
