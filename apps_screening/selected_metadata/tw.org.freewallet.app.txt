I was assured my token would be in the Token Wallet. This Token Wallet app doesn't even open, has been discontinued and worse, I've waiting 3 years to get my ERC20 tokens back. I sent another help ticket over 24 hours ago and have received no response.","NO COINS IN MY WALLET BEEN TRYING FOR MONTHS TO RETRIEVE THEM BUT KEEP ON GETTING THE RUN AROUND IVE ALREADY DOWNLOADED NEW FREEWALLET APP WAS TOLD TO LOGIN TO WALLET VIA MOBILE NUMBER AND FUNDS WILL SHOW UP BUT NOTHING SENT SCREENSHOTS OF MY WALLET TRIED LOGGING IN WITH FACEBOOK AND GOOGLE NOTHING CONTACT SUPPORT A HUNDRED TIMES NOTHING THIS SMELLS OF SCAM KEEP RIGHT AWAY √ÄM THINKING OF FILING A REPORT TO POLICE AND SEEKING LEGAL ADVICE STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!","Attempting to sign up for the first time, tried 4 different email accounts to be told each one is already in use.
