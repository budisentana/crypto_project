TOTP, HOTP, mOTP (Mobile-OTP) and Steam are supported. The generated codes are one time tokens that provide an extra layer of security to your online accounts. After scanning a simple QR code, your account is protected.\r\n\r\nPlease direct all feedback / issues to either GitHub or email (developer contact section) instead of writing a review to more easily follow up on your issue.\nFrequently Asked Questions:\r\nhttps://github.com/jamie-mh/AuthenticatorPro/wiki#frequently-asked-questions\r\n\r\nCompatibility\r\nAuthenticator Pro is compatible with most providers and accounts. View some supported providers here: https://twofactorauth.org/ (marked with \"software token\").\r\n\r\nBackup / Restore\r\nBackup your authenticators with strong encryption. In case you lose your or change phone, you can always gain access to your accounts. Save to cloud storage or to your device.\r\n\r\nImport\r\nEasily migrate your accounts to Authenticator Pro from supported alternative apps.\r\n\r\nDark Mode\r\nAuthenticator Pro has a beautiful material design inspired look in either light or dark themes.\r\n\r\nIcons\r\nFind your authenticators easily with recognisable brand logos and icons next to each code.\r\n\r\nCategories\r\nOrganise your authenticators into categories.\r\n\r\nOffline with few permissions\r\nAuthenticator Pro only requires a single permission and does not require Internet access to function.\r\n\r\nCustomisation\r\nSet icons and rename. You can also arrange your authenticators in any order you like so you can find them easily.\r\n\r\nWear OS\r\nAuthenticator Pro is also available as a Wear OS companion app. Quickly view your authenticators directly from your watch.\r\n\r\nSecurity\r\nSet a password and use biometric authentification to protect your codes.\r\n\r\nOpen-Source\r\nThe application source code can be viewed by anyone on GitHub.\r\n\r\n\r\n2 Factor authentication provides an extra layer of security to your accounts by requiring the use of a one time code to log in. In addition to your username and password, you will need a code provided by Authenticator Pro. So even if your login details are compromised, your account remains safe.\r\n\r\n\r\nFree and Open-Source\r\nhttps://github.com/jamie-mh/AuthenticatorPro\r\n\r\nPermissions:\r\n\r\nCamera permission is required to add accounts through QR codes.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer:\r\n\r\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
