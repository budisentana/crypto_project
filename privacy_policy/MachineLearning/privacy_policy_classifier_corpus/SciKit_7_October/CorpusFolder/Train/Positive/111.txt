Children's Privacy Policy Some of our websites  products and services (applications) or application features are general interest applications designed for older users. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children in connection with those websites  applications  or features.  Others applications are appropriate for use by children  and in that case this Children's Privacy Policy applies. Where there is a conflict between this Children's Privacy Policy and other sections of our Privacy Statement  this Children's Privacy Policy sets the standard for how we will treat children's personal information.  'Our Children''s Privacy Policy explains: our information collection practices how we might disclose personal information  and our parental consent practices'  in accordance with the U.S. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).  COPPA applies to information provided online by children under the age of 13 (child or children). For more information about COPPA and general tips about protecting children's online privacy  please visit OnGuard Online.  'Here are some quick links to help you find information: Information we collect from children  how we use it  and how and when we communicate with parents Registration Verifiable parental consent Specific activities When information collected from children is available to third parties Parental Choices and Controls'  Information we collect from children  how we use it  and how and when we communicate with parents  Here are ways in which we collect personal information from children  as well as how and when we will provide parental notice and/or seek parental consent. In the event we discover we have collected information from a child in a manner inconsistent with COPPA's requirements  we will promptly either delete the information or seek the parent's consent for that collection.  'Consistent with what COPPA requires  where we have an age screen in place and we determine the user is age 12 or under  we will: ask for a parent or guardian email address before we collect personal information from the child  or offer an age-appropriate experience for the child  consistent with COPPA requirements  or not allow access to those sections or features the site or application directed to a general interest audience (those age 13 and over).'  'Consistent with what COPPA requires  where we have an age screen   in place and we determine the user is age 12 or under  we will: ask for a parent   or guardian email address before we collect personal information from the child'    'Registration Where an application is age appropriate  children can register with our website or application to (among other things): view  interact with and download content take tutorials  create  edit  and import content like or follow other creators and their content comment on others'' content upload a photo participate in contests view in application notifications create wishlists of items they are interested in (like robotics kits)'  'During the registration process  we may ask the child to provide certain personal information for security purposes and so we can send notices to parents  including: a parent or guardian''s email address the child''s first name the child''s member or account username  and password'  'During the registration process  we may ask the child to provide   certain personal information for security purposes and so we can send notices   to parents  including: a parent or guardian''s email address the child''s first   name the child''s member or account username  and password'    We also may ask for birth dates from children to validate their ages.  We also may ask for birth dates from children to validate their   ages.    'A child''s username will be either: a random combination of words suggested by our systems  or a child can select their own username  and we suggest that children not provide any personal information in their usernames'  If a child chooses not to share their personal information (i.e.  a parent or guardian's email for purposes of consent) with us  this limits their access to account creation and certain features.  We will not require a child to provide more information than is reasonably necessary in order to participate in an online activity.  'Also  we will keep the information consistent with our retention practices - that is: to honor your choices to fulfill the purposes described in this privacy statement; for example: only so long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the activity request or allow the child to continue to participate in the activity to help ensure the security of our users and our services as required or permitted by applicable laws and regulations'  Verifiable parental consent Depending on the website or application  we may seek different types of parental consent. In each case  when we ask for consent we will provide notice about the specific activities available to a child through the website or application.  'Parental consent Because our websites and applications include activities that allow children to create  share and publically post content  to become a full member we seek high-level consent from a parent as follows: by asking for a credit card or other payment method for verification (with a nominal charge involved)  or by requiring a signed consent form by mail or email attachment.'  We also require a parent to open their own account so that they can view and moderate their child's account. For further details  please see Parental Choices and Controls below.  After providing high-level consent  we may offer parents the opportunity to use a pin or password in future communications as a way to confirm the parent's identity.  Teacher consent in lieu of a parent For school-based activities  COPPA allows teachers and school administrators to act in the place of parents to provide consent for the collection of personal information from children. Schools should always notify parents about these activities.  In some cases  in order that an account is not closed and so that a child can continue to use a website or application outside of the school context  we may ask schools to obtain consent directly from a parent instead of and/or in addition to providing consent in the place of a parent.  For more information on parental rights with respect to a child's educational record under the U.S. Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)  please see the FERPA section below.  Specific activities Content Generated by a Child Our websites and applications include activities that allow children to create or manipulate content and save it. Some of these activities do not require children to provide any personal information and therefore may not result in notice to the parent or require parental consent.  If an activity potentially allows a child to insert personal information in their created content  we will seek a high level parental consent.  Examples of child created content that may include personal information are open-text fields drawings that allow text or free-hand entry of information uploaded content that includes text  models or images  When  in addition to collecting content that includes personal information  we allow children to share content publicly  we will obtain high-level parental consent.  We honor the requests of minors to delete any content that they post on our websites and applications  unless we are required by law to retain it. Please see the removing content you have posted section for more information.  Forums and comments Certain activities allow users to communicate directly with other users by means user forums or comments sections. We first seek high level parental consent before allowing a child access to such features.  We strongly encourage children who use these interactive features on our websites and in our applications never to provide personal information about themselves or any third party  and not to attempt to circumvent any moderation features.  We also recommend that parents carefully supervise their children when the children participate in online activities.  Contests In all of our contests  we will require only the information necessary to enter the contest  such as user name and parent email address (to notify the parent where required by law). We only contact the parent for more personalized information for prize-fulfillment purposes if the child wins the contest.  Contests In all of our contests  we will require only the information   necessary to enter the contest  such as user name and parent email address (to   notify the parent where required by law).    We only contact the parent for more personalized information for   prize-fulfillment purposes if the child wins the contest.    Email Contact with a Child In some of our applications  we may collect online contact information  such as an email address  in order to communicate with a child who makes a specific request through customer service. For example  a child may email us to ask for help in understanding how to use a design tool if she or he is having trouble with. Or the child may want to sign up for a monthly newsletter. Here is how we would handle communication requests. One time communication  Email Contact with a Child In some of our applications  we may   collect online contact information  such as an email address  in order to communicate   with a child who makes a specific request through customer service.    For example  a child may email us to ask for help in understanding   how to use a design tool if she or he is having trouble with.    Here is how we would handle communication requests.    One time communication    Or the child may want to sign up for a monthly newsletter.    After we respond to the child's question or request  we or our service provider will delete this information immediately after responding to the question or request. Communicating more than once  'Where there is an activity or service where we need to communicate with a child more than once and we have not already obtained parental consent: If we collect the child''s contact information for ongoing communications (like for a newsletter)  we will also require a parent''s email address (if we have not already obtained verifiable parental consent) so we can notify the parent about the collection and use  and to provide the parent with an opportunity to prevent further contact with the child. If a child is engaged in more than one ongoing communication  the parent may need to opt-out of each communication separately.'  If a child is engaged in more than one ongoing communication  the   parent may need to opt-out of each communication separately.    'Where there is an activity or service where we need to communicate   with a child more than once and we have not already obtained parental consent:   If we collect the child''s contact information for ongoing communications (like   for a newsletter)  we will also require a parent''s email address (if we have   not already obtained verifiable parental consent) so we can notify the parent   about the collection and use  and to provide the parent with an opportunity   to prevent further contact with the child.'

Education and FERPA If you are using our applications through a school program  your personal information may be subject to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). We have included information here that is most relevant to our products and services when they are used by schools that are subject to FERPA. You can look at the U.S. Department of Education website for more information.  FERPA is a United States law that provides certain rights with respect to student education records and personal information associated with those records. Parents exercise these rights on behalf of their children under 18. These rights transfer to the student when he or she reaches the age of 18 or attends a school beyond the high school (12 th grade) level  known as eligible students.  'FERPA gives parents and eligible students certain rights (subject to limitations)  including: the right to inspect and review the student''s education records maintained by the school the right to request that a school correct records which they believe to be inaccurate or misleading.'  'As a general rule  schools subject to FERPA must have written permission from the parent or eligible student in order to release any information from a student''s education record. However  under certain circumstances schools are allowed to disclose records without consent  including under the following conditions: to school officials with legitimate educational interest this can include vendors providing services to schools to other schools to which a student is transferring directory information (subject to an opt-out) to appropriate officials in cases of health and safety emergencies.'  Schools are required to notify parents and eligible students annually of their rights under FERPA. Each school can choose how to provide notification (for example  sending a special letter or including the information in a student handbook).  We help schools comply with their obligations under FERPA in various ways  depending on the application being used. This can include obtaining consent directly from a parent or eligible student and providing them with direct access to relevant information within our applications  or providing schools with the ability to manage parent or eligible student requests.
