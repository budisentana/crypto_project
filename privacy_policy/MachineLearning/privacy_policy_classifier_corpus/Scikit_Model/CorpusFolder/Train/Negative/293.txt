Careers  Privacy Policy (Effective November 1  2016) Privacy Policy Acceptable Use Advertising Standards Responsible Disclosure  Thank you for using Pinterest! We wrote this policy to help you understand what information we collect  how we use it  and what choices you have. Because we're an internet company  some of the concepts below are a little technical  but we've tried our best to explain things in a simple and clear way. We welcome your questions and comments on this policy.  'What information do we collect? We collect information in a few different ways: 1. When you give it to us or give us permission to obtain it'  When you sign up for or use our products  you voluntarily give us certain information. This can include your name  profile photo  Pins  comments  likes  the email address or phone number you used to sign up  and any other information you provide us. If you're using Pinterest on your mobile device  you can also choose to provide us with location data. And if you choose to buy something on Pinterest  you provide us with payment information  contact information (ex.  address and phone number)  and what you purchased. If you buy something for someone else on Pinterest  you'd also provide us with their shipping details and contact information.  If you're using Pinterest on your mobile device  you can also choose   to provide us with location data.    This can include your name  profile photo  Pins  comments  likes    the email address or phone number you used to sign up  and any other information   you provide us.    When you sign up for or use our products  you voluntarily give   us certain information.    You also may give us permission to access your information in other services.

You also may give us permission to access your information in other   services.    2. We also get technical information when you use our products  These days  whenever you use a website  mobile application  or other\ \ internet service  there's certain information that almost always gets created\ \ and recorded automatically. The same is true when you use our products. Here\ \ are some of the types of information we collect: \u2022 Log data. When you use\ \ Pinterest  our servers automatically record information (\log data\)  including\ \ information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website or your mobile\ \ app sends when you're using it. This log data may include your Internet Protocol\ \ address  the address of the web pages you visited that had Pinterest features \ \ browser type and settings  the date and time of your request  how you used Pinterest \ \ and cookie data.

Depending on how you're accessing our products \ \ we may use \cookies\ (small text files sent by your computer each time you\ \ visit our website  unique to your Pinterest account or your browser) or similar\ \ technologies to record log data. When we use cookies  we may use \session\\ \ cookies (that last until you close your browser) or \persistent\ cookies (that\ \ last until you or your browser delete them). For example  we may use cookies\ \ to store your language preferences or other Pinterest settings so you don't\ \ have to set them up every time you visit Pinterest. Some of the cookies we use\ \ are associated with your Pinterest account (including personal information about\ \ you  such as the email address you gave us)  and other cookies are not.

Our partners and advertisers may share information with us  We may get information about you and your activity off Pinterest\ \ from our affiliates  advertisers  partners and other third parties we work with.\ \ For example: \u2022 Some websites or apps use Pinterest features like our \\ Save\ button. If so  we may collect log information (described above) from those\ \ sites or apps.  \u2022 Online advertisers typically share information with the websites\ \ or apps where they run ads to measure and/or improve those ads. We also receive\ \ this information  which may include information like whether clicks on ads led\ \ to purchases or a list of criteria to use in targeting ads.  To learn more about the types of information advertisers may share with us  please see our Help Center.  How do we use the information we collect? We use the information we collect to provide our products to you and make them better  develop new products  and protect Pinterest and our users. For example  we may log how often people use two different versions of a product  which can help us understand which version is better. If you make a purchase on Pinterest  we'll save your payment information and contact information so that you can use them the next time you want to buy something on Pinterest.

We also use the information we collect to offer you customized content \ \ including: \u2022 Suggesting Pins or boards you might like. For example  if\ \ you've indicated that you're interested in cooking or visited recipe websites\ \ that have Pinterest features  we may suggest food-related Pins  boards  or people\ \ that we think you might like.  \u2022 Showing you ads you might be interested in. For example  if\ \ you purchased a camping tent on Pinterest  we may show you ads for other outdoorsy\ \ products.  We also use the information we collect to: \u2022 Send you updates\ \ (such as when certain activity  like repins or comments  happens on Pinterest) \ \ newsletters  marketing materials and other information that may be of interest\ \ to you. For example  depending on your email notification settings  we may send\ \ you weekly updates that include Pins you may like. You can decide to stop getting\ \ these updates by updating your account settings (or through other settings we\ \ may provide).  \u2022 Help your friends and contacts find you on Pinterest. For\ \ example  if you sign up using a Facebook account  we may help your Facebook\ \ friends find your account on Pinterest when they first sign up for Pinterest.\ \ Or  we may allow people to search for your account on Pinterest using your email\ \ address. \u2022 Respond to your questions or comments.

What choices do you have about your information? Our goal is to give\ \ you simple and meaningful choices over your information. If you have a Pinterest\ \ account  many of the choices you have on Pinterest are built directly into the\ \ product or your account settings. For example  you can: \u2022 Access and change\ \ information in your profile page at any time  choose whether your profile page\ \ is available to search engines  or choose whether others can find your Pinterest\ \ account using your email address.  For example  you can: \u2022 Access and change information in\   \ your profile page at any time  choose whether your profile page is available\   \ to search engines  or choose whether others can find your Pinterest account\   \ using your email address.    If you have a Pinterest account  many of the choices you have on   Pinterest are built directly into the product or your account settings.    Our goal is to give you simple and meaningful choices over your   information.    What choices do you have about your information?    \u2022 Link or unlink your Pinterest account from an account on another\ \ service (e.g.  Facebook or Twitter). For some services (like Facebook)  you\ \ can also choose whether or not to publish your activity on Pinterest to that\ \ service.  \u2022 Create or be added to a secret board. Secret boards are visible\ \ to you and other participants in the board  and any participant may choose to\ \ make the contents of the board available to anyone else. For example  another\ \ participant may invite someone else to the board  make the board available to\ \ an app they use to view Pinterest  or even just take an image from the board\ \ and email it to their friends. For more information about secret boards  please\ \ visit our Help Center.  \u2022 Choose whether Pinterest will be customized for you using\ \ information from off-Pinterest websites or apps. If you have a Pinterest account\ \ and want to control how your off-Pinterest data is used to tailor your experience \ \ you can visit your account settings and update your preferences. If you don't\ \ have a Pinterest account  or don't want us to customize Pinterest for you when\ \ you're signed out  you can opt out here.  \u2022 Choose whether your purchases on Pinterest will be used to\ \ customize recommendations and ads for you. You can view and manage your purchase\ \ history by going to \Order history\ in your account settings  and if you hide\ \ a purchase from your history  we won't use it to customize Pinterest for you.\ \ \u2022 Also  we support the Do Not Track browser setting  and you can learn\ \ more about how it affects our collection and use of off-Pinterest data.  \u2022 Close your account at any time. When you close your account \ \ we'll deactivate it and remove your pins and boards from Pinterest. We may retain\ \ archived copies of your information as required by law or for legitimate business\ \ purposes (including to help address fraud and spam).  In addition to the examples above  we offer other choices that you can learn more about in our Help Center.  You may have choices available to you through the device or software\ \ you use to access Pinterest. For example: \u2022 The browser you use may provide\ \ you with the ability to control cookies or other types of local data storage.\ \ \u2022 Your mobile device may provide you with choices around how and whether\ \ location or other data is shared with us.  For example: \u2022 The browser you use may provide you with the\   \ ability to control cookies or other types of local data storage.    You may have choices available to you through the device or software   you use to access Pinterest.    \u2022 Your mobile device may provide you with choices around\   \ how and whether location or other data is shared with us.    To learn more about these choices  please see the information provided by the device or software provider.  How and when do we share information? Anyone can see the public boards\ \ and Pins you create  and the profile information you give us. We may also make\ \ this public information available through what are called \APIs\ (basically\ \ a technical way to share information quickly). For example  a partner might\ \ use a Pinterest API to study what their most popular Pins are or how their Pins\ \ are being shared on Pinterest. The other limited instances where we may share\ \ your personal information include: \u2022 When we have your consent. This includes\ \ sharing information with other services (like Facebook or Twitter) when you've\ \ chosen to link to your Pinterest account to those services or publish your activity\ \ on Pinterest to them. For example  you can choose to publish your Pins to Facebook\ \ or Twitter.  \u2022 When you buy something on Pinterest using your credit card \ \ we may share your credit card information  contact information  and other information\ \ about the transaction with the merchant you're buying from. The merchants treat\ \ this information just as if you had made a purchase from their website directly \ \ which means their privacy policies and marketing policies apply to the information\ \ we share with them. \u2022 If you buy something on Pinterest using Apple Pay \ \ your credit card number is not shared with the merchant  but contact and transaction\ \ information is still shared.  \u2022 Online advertisers typically use third party companies to\ \ audit the delivery and performance of their ads on websites and apps. We also\ \ allow these companies to collect this information on Pinterest. To learn more \ \ please see our Help Center.  \u2022 We may employ third party companies or individuals to process\ \ personal information on our behalf based on our instructions and in compliance\ \ with this Privacy Policy. For example  we share credit card information with\ \ the payment companies we use to store your payment information. Or  we may share\ \ data with a security consultant to help us get better at identifying spam. In\ \ addition  some of the information we request may be collected by third party\ \ providers on our behalf. For more information about the providers we use  please\ \ see our Help Center.  \u2022 If we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply\ \ with a law  regulation or legal request; to protect the safety  rights  or property\ \ of the public  any person  or Pinterest; or to detect  prevent  or otherwise\ \ address fraud  security or technical issues. We may share the information described\ \ in this Policy with our wholly-owned subsidiaries and affiliates. We may engage\ \ in a merger  acquisition  bankruptcy  dissolution  reorganization  or similar\ \ transaction or proceeding that involves the transfer of the information described\ \ in this Policy. We may also share aggregated or non-personally identifiable\ \ information with our partners  advertisers or others. For example  we may tell\ \ an advertiser on Pinterest how many people saved something they shared  or the\ \ percentage of people who click on a Pin after viewing it.  Our policy on children's information Pinterest is not directed to children under 13. If you learn that your minor child has provided us with personal information without your consent  please contact us.  How do we make changes to this policy? We may change this policy from time to time  and if we do we'll post any changes on this page. If you continue to use Pinterest after those changes are in effect  you agree to the revised policy. If the changes are significant  we may provide more prominent notice or get your consent as required by law.  How can you contact us? The best way to contact us is online through the Help Center.
