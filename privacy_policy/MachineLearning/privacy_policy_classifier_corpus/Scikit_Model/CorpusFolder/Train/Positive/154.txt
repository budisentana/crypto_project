We're here to provide you with tools and services that are designed to help you make financial progress. Before you get started  we'd like to tell you more about what we do with information we collect about you.  When you use  access or interact with our Services (which we define for you in Section 1 of our Terms of Service)  you are agreeing to our Terms of Service and consenting to how we collect  share and otherwise use information about you as described in this Privacy Policy. Since we do collect information about you  you should also know we're committed to securing our systems and the protection of your data-you can find more details on our Security Practices here.  In other words  as legalese-y as they are  please read these documents carefully.  What This Policy Covers This Privacy Policy covers how Credit Karma  Inc. and its affiliated companies (collectively  Credit Karma  we  us or our) collect  share and use information in connection with your access and use of our Services. It does not cover the privacy practices of third parties that we do not own or control.  That said  you should know that we may provide third party content or links to third-party web sites or applications  or include features that allow you to connect your Credit Karma account with your accounts with third parties  such as financial institutions or social media platforms like Facebook. When you leave our Services or interact with a third-party feature  you should also read the applicable third party's privacy policies and terms of service to make sure you understand how they might collect and share information about you (everybody is different).  'What Information We Collect To put it simply  there are three main ways we collect information about you: when you give it to us  with automatic technologies and when we ask others for it. Allow us to explain.'  'Information You Provide to Us We may ask you to provide certain information to us through various forms  features or other means throughout our Services. A couple of examples are our registration form for new members and feedback forms where you send us comments  questions or other feedback. The types of information we may collect from you fit in two general categories: Personal Information: This is information that identifies you personally  such as your name  address  email address  Social Security number or phone number. Non-Personal Information: This is information about you or your household that doesn''t identify you personally  like your gender  income or what types of financial products you''re interested in.'  'Non-Personal Information: This is information about you or your   household that doesn''t identify you personally  like your gender  income or   what types of financial products you''re interested in.'    'The types of information we may collect from you fit in two general   categories: Personal Information: This is information that identifies you personally    such as your name  address  email address  Social Security number or phone number.'    When we combine information that isn't Personal Information (like Non-Personal Information or Usage Information  which we explain below) with Personal Information  we treat it like Personal Information for as long as it is combined.  'Information We Automatically Collect In addition to information you provide to us  we automatically collect certain information about how you access and interact with our Services (Usage Information). This Usage Information is a key part of how we improve your Credit Karma experience and provide more personalized insights and recommendations. We and our business partners may use various technologies to collect and store Usage Information in connection with our Services. These may include things like cookies  browser web storage (e.g.  HTML5)  web beacons and similar technologies. There are three types of Usage Information we may collect: Device Information. This is information about how you access our Services  such as the operating system  hardware model  application or browser type and version  and unique identifiers associated with your device. We may also integrate with built-in device features (e.g.  when you turn on fingerprint access for your Credit Karma account).'

We and our business partners may use various technologies to collect   and store Usage Information in connection with our Services.    Log Information. There are certain pieces of information we automatically collect in system logs or similar files about how you interact with our Services  such as which features you visit or click on. This Log Information may also include things like your IP address  browser or device configuration  date and time of access and cookie information.  This Log Information may also include things like your IP address    browser or device configuration  date and time of access and cookie information.    Location Information. We may use certain information like your IP address or other Device Information or Log Information to estimate your location (e.g.  your city or state). We may also request to use location-enabled services on your device (which typically provide GPS or Wi-Fi access point details) to enhance our Services. We will only use these location-enabled services on your device with your consent  though.

We may use certain information like your IP address or other Device   Information or Log Information to estimate your location (e.g.  your city or   state).    Information Third Parties Provide About You Many of our features rely on information about you that we collect from third parties  such as the free credit reports and credit scores we request on your behalf from TransUnion and Equifax. We may also work with different third party data partners to supplement the Usage Information and other information we collect directly from you. For example  our business partners may provide us with information about special offers available based on your credit profile so that we can give you more personalized recommendations. We might also collect information from other users like you through things like a member referral program.  'How We Use the Information We Collect We use the information we collect from you and third parties to operate our Services  communicate with you  conduct research and development to improve or enhance our Services and our users'' experience  and promote our Services. These are a few examples: Providing features like your free credit reports and scores. When you register for a member account  we use the Personal Information you provide in order to create and maintain your Member Profile and provide you free credit reports and scores from our credit bureau partners. Credit Karma offers much more than free credit reports and scores though  and the information we collect as you use our Services also goes into developing and bringing you our various other features like free credit monitoring  tracking your spending and personalized offer recommendations.'  Improving our recommendations and insights. The information we collect also helps us tailor our content and improve the way we match you to recommended offers or insights about your credit health. We're constantly working on ways to better identify and present the information that's most relevant to you.  Communicating with you. We may use information we collect to provide you with member support or to send you things like service-related announcements  credit monitoring alerts  recommendations  offers from our business partners and other updates or promotions. Most of the time we'll communicate with you by email  but we may also send you push notifications or even snail mail. For information on how to adjust your communications preferences  check out our aptly named Communications Preferences section below.  'Legal reasons. We reserve the right to access  use  preserve  transfer or disclose  at any time without notice to you  any information (including Personal Information) as reasonably necessary to: Comply with any applicable law  regulation  subpoena or legal process  or respond to any governmental requests and cooperate with law enforcement  if we believe such action is required or permitted by law; Enforce our Terms of Service  including investigating any potential violations; Protect the safety  integrity  rights or security of our members  our Services or equipment  or any third party; or Detect  prevent or otherwise address fraud  security or technical issues related to our Services or our business partners.'  'When We Share the Information We Collect First  we want to be clear about how we do not share information about you (what we call the No-Nos): We do not share your credit reports or scores with unaffiliated third parties (except agents acting on our behalf; we explain that below). We do not sell or rent Personal Information to unaffiliated third parties for their advertising or marketing lists.'  'Now that we''ve covered the No-Nos  let us explain how we could share with third parties. We may share information about you  including Personal Information  with third parties in the following circumstances: Agents acting on our behalf. We may share information about you with service providers or agents in order to have them perform on our behalf any of the activities we are permitted to conduct under this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service. This includes things like designing or operating features  helping us research and test feature improvements  identifying offers or personalized recommendations  performing analytics and marketing our Services. These third parties are acting on our behalf so while they may have access to your information  including things like your credit reports and scores  they''re required to follow our instructions and meet the standards explained in our Privacy Policy when handling information about you that we provide them.'  When we collaborate with third parties to provide and improve our Services. We may sometimes share information about you with our business partners or other third parties we collaborate with in connection with providing or improving our Services. This can occur  for example  when we're providing an integrated or co-branded feature with a business partner (e.g.  our Credit Score Simulator) or doing a joint research project with another organization to help improve our Services. We may also share information like the feedback you submit to us if it relates to both our Services and a business partner's products. When we share information with third-party collaborators  our collaborators are obligated to follow the No-Nos above  but may also use the information in connection with their own activities to the extent allowed under their own privacy practices (e.g.  respond to your feedback  conduct additional research  or improve a feature of theirs).  Our business partners when you ask for their services. We may also give you opportunities to interact with third party business partners through our Services (for instance  when you submit a loan application that we pre-populate with your information). In these situations  we will either tell you we'll be sending your information before we do so or we will send you to the business partner's site or platform for you to provide the information directly to them. Remember that any information you provide to the third-party business partner  whether through us or on your own  will be subject to their privacy practices and terms and conditions.  When you publicly post the information. As part of our Services  we may provide opportunities for you to publicly post reviews  questions  comments  suggestions or other content  which may include Personal Information and portions of your Member Profile designated as public profile information  like your name or user name. Anything you share in a public forum is  obviously  public  so think carefully about what you decide to share. You should also read our Community Rules for more information on what is appropriate to post. If you would like us to remove Personal Information included in Community Content  contact us at legal@creditkarma.com. In some cases  we may not be able to remove your Personal Information  but we will try to respond to let you know why.  As Part of a Corporate Change. We may disclose and transfer information about you to a third party as part of  or in preparation for  a change of control  restructuring  corporate change  or sale or transfer of assets. If such a business transfer results in a material change in the treatment of your Personal Information  you will be notified by e-mail (using the primary email address on your account) or by a prominent notice on our site.

(You can read more about these in the How We Use the Information We Collect section above.)  With Your Consent. There may also be other limited contexts in which we share specific types of personal information with your express consent.  How to Access  Update or Deactivate Your Account Accessing and Updating Your Account Information You are responsible for maintaining the accuracy of the information you provide to us  such as your Member Profile information. You can access and make changes to certain Personal Information at any time by logging in to your account through our website and updating your Personal Information page.  Communications Preferences You can manage your communications preferences by visiting your account profile. For example  you can choose which types of monitoring alerts you want to receive. We'll also include unsubscribe instructions in any marketing emails. You can also adjust app-specific communications settings (e.g.  for things like push notifications) within the settings screen of the mobile app. Technology moves fast  so the types of communications and communication preference options might change from time to time.  Canceling Your Membership and Deactivating Your Account We hope this never happens  but if you decide you no longer want to use our Services  you can cancel and deactivate your account on our help page.  'One more thing to note: Due to our recordkeeping and information retention requirements  we do not delete information about you upon deactivation. We will  however  disable your account and stop sending you further communications. Furthermore  except to the extent necessary for legal or regulatory recordkeeping purposes  we anonymize the data in your Member Profile two years after you deactivate your account. It may take a little more time for our automated backup systems to fully process the anonymized account  though.'
