Samsung Privacy Policy--SmartTV Supplement Samsung makes available Internet-connected televisions and Blu-Ray players and other similar technologies that connect to your television set (collectively  the SmartTV services or SmartTV). Samsung's SmartTV services offer features that may enhance video content  customized TV  movie  and other content recommendations  connections to social networking services  and the ability to control and interact with your SmartTV with gestures and voice commands. We collect  use  share  and store information through your SmartTV in the ways described in the Samsung Privacy Policy. This Supplement provides additional details about the privacy practices of some SmartTV features.  Recommendations and Customized Content The SmartTV is designed to enable you to easily find and access video programming and other content. For example  you may access information about live television programs distributed to you by your cable or satellite operator and on-demand video content offerings distributed by third-party content providers through searchable guides displayed on your SmartTV.  'In the case of live television programs  we determine what content is available to you based in part on your zip code. In addition  the SmartTV helps make the searchable guides and other SmartTV content more relevant to you by highlighting programming and content that is likely to interest you  such as episodes of programs that you may have missed and new programs  applications and other content that we believe you will find of interest. We base these recommendations on: Information about content that you have watched  purchased  downloaded  or streamed through Samsung applications on your SmartTV or other devices; Information about applications you have accessed through the SmartTV panels; Information about your clicks on the Like  Dislike  Watch Now  and other buttons on your SmartTV; The query terms you enter into SmartTV search features  including when you search for particular video content; and Other SmartTV usage and device information  including  but not limited to  IP address  information stored in cookies and similar technologies  information that identifies your hardware or software configuration  browser information  and the page(s) you request.'  In addition  the SmartTV helps make the searchable guides and other   SmartTV content more relevant to you by highlighting programming and content   that is likely to interest you  such as episodes of programs that you may have   missed and new programs  applications and other content that we believe you   will find of interest.    In the case of live television programs  we determine what content   is available to you based in part on your zip code.

In addition  if you enable the collection of information about video streams viewed on your SmartTV  we may collect that information and additional information about the network  channels  and programs that you view through the SmartTV. We will use such information to improve the recommendations that we deliver to you on the SmartTV.  Please visit the settings menu of your SmartTV for choices that may be available to you if you do not wish to continue to receive personalized recommendations on your SmartTV. If you disable personalized recommendations  then the information and content displayed on your SmartTV may not be as relevant to you. Samsung may still collect information about your usage of the SmartTV for the purposes described in this Samsung Privacy Policy.  SyncPlus and Interactive Marketing By enabling SyncPlus or other marketing features  you may make the content and advertising that you receive on your SmartTV and other devices when you are watching SmartTV more interactive. TV programming providers or advertisers can enhance video programs by providing interactive content  such as in-program trivia  show insights  games  and promotions  on your SmartTV or other devices. Similarly  advertisers can enhance their ads by enabling users to take immediate action (e.g.  downloading a coupon or app) in response to an ad.  To make these kinds of enhancements available  we provide video or audio snippets of the program you're watching to third-party providers that use this information in order to return content or advertising synched to what you're watching. These providers may receive information about your device (e.g.  its IP address and device identifiers) and your interactions with the content and advertising they provide. You may disable these interactive marketing features at any time by visiting the settings menu. The choices you make with respect to interactive marketing features will not affect whether you receive other types of ads and marketing on your SmartTV.  These providers may receive information about your device (e.g.    its IP address and device identifiers) and your interactions with the content   and advertising they provide.    Voice Recognition You can control your Smart TV  and use many of its features  with voice commands.  If you enable Voice Recognition  you can interact with your Smart TV using your voice. To provide you the Voice Recognition feature  some interactive voice commands may be transmitted (along with information about your device  including device identifiers) to a third-party service provider (currently  Nuance Communications  Inc.) that converts your interactive voice commands to text and to the extent necessary to provide the Voice Recognition features to you. In addition  Samsung may collect and your device may capture voice commands and associated texts so that we can provide you with Voice Recognition features and evaluate and improve the features. Samsung will collect your interactive voice commands only when you make a specific search request to the Smart TV by clicking the activation button either on the remote control or on your screen and speaking into the microphone on the remote control.  If you do not enable Voice Recognition  you will not be able to use interactive voice recognition features  although you may be able to control your TV using certain predefined voice commands.  You may disable Voice Recognition data collection at any time by visiting the settings menu. However  this may prevent you from using some of the Voice Recognition features.  Gesture Controls and Facial Recognition Your SmartTV is equipped with a camera that enables certain advanced features  including the ability to control and interact with your TV with gestures and to use facial recognition technology to authenticate your Samsung Account on your TV. The camera can be covered and disabled at any time  but be aware that these advanced services will not be available if the camera is disabled.  Gesture Control.To provide you with the ability to control your SmartTV through gestures  the camera mounted on the top of your SmartTV can recognize your movements. This enables you  for example  to move between panels and zoom in or zoom out. We record information about when and how users use gesture controls so that we can evaluate the performance of these controls and improve them.  Facial Recognition.The camera situated on the SmartTV also enables you to authenticate your Samsung Account or to log into certain services using facial recognition technology. You can use facial recognition instead of  or as a supplementary security measure in addition to  manually inputting your password. Once you complete the steps required to set up facial recognition  an image of your face is stored locally on your TV; it is not transmitted to Samsung. If you cancel your Samsung Account or no longer desire to use facial recognition  please visit the applicable settings menu to delete the stored image. While your image will be stored locally  Samsung may take note of the fact that you have set up the feature and collect information about when and how the feature is used so that we can evaluate the performance of this feature and improve it.
