Uses of Information Camfrog's primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you  the user  with a customized experience on Camfrog and through our partners. This includes personalization services  interactive communications  and many other types of services  most of which are completely free to you. In order to provide services free of charge  we display advertisements and encourage your participation. By knowing a little about you  Camfrog is able to deliver more relevant advertisements and content  and hence better service  to you.  In our role of delivering targeted advertisements  Camfrog plays the middleman. Advertisers give us advertisements and tell us the type of audience they want to reach (for example  males over 35 years old). Camfrog displays the advertisement to users meeting the specified criteria. In this process  the advertiser never has access to individual user information. This kind of advertisement targeting is done with banner ads as well as promotional email through Camfrog and its affiliates. You will only receive special offers via email from Camfrog if you have indicated in your account preferences  or at some other time  that you would like to receive them.
