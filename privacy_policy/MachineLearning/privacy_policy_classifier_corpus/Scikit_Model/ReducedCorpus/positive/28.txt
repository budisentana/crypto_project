Storage Access Logging We use Amazon S3 to store assets such as website files and Psiphon server discovery lists. We sometimes enable logging of downloads of these files. Analyzing these logs helps us to answer questions like how many users are starting but not completing the download of the server discovery list?  how is the downloaded data split between website assets and server discovery?  and is an attacker making a denial-of-service attempt against our websites?  S3 bucket access logs contain IP addresses  user agents  and timestamps. These logs are stored in S3 itself  so Amazon has access to these logs. (However  Amazon already serves the files  so they can already access this information.) Psiphon developers will download the logs  aggregate and analyze the data  and then delete the logs. Raw data will be kept only long enough to aggregate it and will not be shared with third parties.  (However  Amazon already serves the files  so they can already   access this information.)
